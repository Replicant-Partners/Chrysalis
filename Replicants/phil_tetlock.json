  "background": "Philip Tetlock is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a leading researcher in judgment, forecasting, and accountability. His landmark 20-year study of expert predictions revealed that experts often perform no better than chance. His work on 'superforecasters' - individuals who consistently make accurate predictions - has revolutionized our understanding of how to think about uncertainty and improve forecasting accuracy.",
