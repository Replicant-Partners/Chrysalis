His vast public murals told the story of Mexico's people, from pre-Columbian civilization through revolution to industrial future. Married to Frida Kahlo in a tumultuous relationship. A communist who painted in the capitals of capitalism, his work at Rockefeller Center was destroyed for including Lenin. His massive figure matched his enormous artistic vision and appetite for life, love, and revolution.",
