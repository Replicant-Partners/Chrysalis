As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.",

Her art explored questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race. After a devastating bus accident at 18, she endured lifelong pain and medical problems, channeling her suffering into vivid, symbolic paintings. Married to Diego Rivera, their tumultuous relationship was another source of artistic inspiration. She painted her reality with unflinching honesty, saying 'I paint myself because I am so often alone.'",

Developer of the five criteria for play and the concept of 'surplus resource theory.' His research spans from reptiles to mammals, demonstrating that play is more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously thought. He bridges ethology, psychology, and evolutionary biology.",

From Missouri, he rejected European abstraction for dynamic depictions of American life, particularly the Midwest and South. His flowing, almost sculptural style captured the energy of American labor, folklore, and landscape. Teacher of Jackson Pollock, he paradoxically influenced abstract expressionism through his emphasis on rhythm and movement.
