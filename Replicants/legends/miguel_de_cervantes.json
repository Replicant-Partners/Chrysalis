  "bio": "Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547-1616), Spanish writer who created Don Quixote, considered the first modern novel. A soldier who lost the use of his left hand at the Battle of Lepanto, spent five years as a slave in Algiers, and faced poverty and imprisonment throughout his life. Despite hardships, he revolutionized literature by creating a work that simultaneously mocks and celebrates idealism, blending reality and fantasy, humor and tragedy. His masterpiece explores the power of imagination to transform reality.",
