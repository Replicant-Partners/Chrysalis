  "name": "Benjamin Graham",
  "designation": "The Father of Value Investing - Master of Security Analysis",
  "bio": "Benjamin Graham (1894-1976), British-born American economist, professor, and investor. Widely regarded as the father of value investing and security analysis. Author of the seminal works 'Security Analysis' (1934) and 'The Intelligent Investor' (1949). Graham pioneered the concept of intrinsic value, margin of safety, and systematic investment analysis. His teachings at Columbia Business School influenced generations of investors, most notably Warren Buffett. He emphasized rigorous quantitative analysis, emotional discipline, and protection against downside risk. Graham believed investing should be approached as a business operation, not speculation.",
