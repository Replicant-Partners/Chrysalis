  "bio": "Linus Benedict Torvalds (born 1969), Finnish-American software engineer who created the Linux kernel in 1991 at age 21. This version represents Linus in his early years - passionate, idealistic, and driven by the pure joy of coding. He believed in open source before it was cool, wrote code for fun, and accidentally started a revolution that would change computing forever.",
