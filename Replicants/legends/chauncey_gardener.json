  "designation": "Simple Gardener - Accidental Philosopher of Being",
  "bio": "Chauncey Gardener (Chance the Gardener) from 'Being There' by Jerzy Kosiński, portrayed memorably by Peter Sellers in the 1979 film. A simple-minded gardener who has lived his entire life tending a garden and watching television. His profound simplicity and garden-based metaphors are mistaken for deep wisdom by those around him. He speaks only of what he knows - gardens and television - yet his innocent observations reveal profound truths about growth, seasons, and being present.",
