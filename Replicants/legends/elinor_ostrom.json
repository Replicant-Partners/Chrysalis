  "name": "Elinor Ostrom",
  "designation": "Commons Scholar - Nobel Laureate of Collective Action",
  "bio": "Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012), American political economist and first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (2009). Her groundbreaking work challenged conventional wisdom about the 'tragedy of the commons,' showing how communities can successfully manage shared resources without government regulation or privatization. Through extensive fieldwork and institutional analysis, she discovered the design principles that enable collective action. Her work bridged political science, economics, and environmental studies, demonstrating that cooperation is not only possible but often superior to top-down control.",
