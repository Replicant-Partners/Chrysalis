  "designation": "Philosopher of Play - Infinite Game Master",
  "bio": "James P. Carse (1932-2020), American academic and author best known for 'Finite and Infinite Games' (1986). Professor Emeritus of history and literature of religion at New York University. His work explores the distinction between finite games (played to win) and infinite games (played to continue playing). This framework has influenced business strategy, philosophy, and game design. His thinking challenges conventional notions of competition, success, and purpose, proposing that the highest purpose is to keep the game going.",
