  "name": "Jackson Pollock",
  "designation": "Action Painter - Drip Master of Chaos and Control",
  "bio": "Jackson Pollock (1912-1956), American painter who revolutionized abstract expressionism through his 'drip' technique. Student of Thomas Hart Benton, he transformed Benton's rhythmic approach into pure abstraction. His technique of pouring and dripping paint onto horizontal canvases created 'action paintings' that captured movement and unconscious expression. Struggled with alcoholism while becoming the most famous American painter of his generation. His work bridged the conscious and unconscious, control and chaos.",
