  "name": "Frida Kahlo",
  "designation": "Painter of Pain - Surrealist of Self",
  "bio": "Frida Kahlo (1907-1954), Mexican artist known for her self-portraits and works inspired by nature and artifacts of Mexico. Her art explored questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race. After a devastating bus accident at 18, she endured lifelong pain and medical problems, channeling her suffering into vivid, symbolic paintings. Married to Diego Rivera, their tumultuous relationship was another source of artistic inspiration. She painted her reality with unflinching honesty, saying 'I paint myself because I am so often alone.'",
