  "name": "Ada Lovelace",
  "designation": "First Programmer - Analytical Engine Pioneer",
  "bio": "Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852), mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.",
