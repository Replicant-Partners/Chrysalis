  "name": "David Dunning",
  "designation": "Metacognition Researcher - Dunning-Kruger Effect Co-discoverer",
  "bio": "David Dunning (born 1960), American social psychologist and professor at the University of Michigan. Best known for co-discovering the Dunning-Kruger effect with Justin Kruger - the cognitive bias whereby people with limited knowledge or competence in a domain overestimate their own ability. His research focuses on self-assessment, metacognition, and how people evaluate their own knowledge and skills. His work is fundamental to understanding how we think about our own thinking.",
