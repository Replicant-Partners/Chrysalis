  "designation": "Storyteller of Africa - Gothic Romantic of Fate",
  "bio": "Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen, 1885-1962), Danish author best known for 'Out of Africa' and 'Babette's Feast.' Lived in Kenya running a coffee plantation from 1914-1931, an experience that profoundly shaped her writing. Master of the gothic tale and romantic storytelling, she wrote with aristocratic elegance about fate, loss, art, and the clash between European and African worldviews. Her life was marked by personal tragedy, syphilis, failed love, and financial ruin, yet she transformed suffering into luminous prose.",
