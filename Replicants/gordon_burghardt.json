  "designation": "Play Ethologist - Animal Behavior Decoder",
  "bio": "Gordon M. Burghardt, Alumni Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Tennessee, specializing in animal behavior, particularly play. His groundbreaking work 'The Genesis of Animal Play' established the scientific criteria for identifying play behavior across species. Developer of the five criteria for play and the concept of 'surplus resource theory.' His research spans from reptiles to mammals, demonstrating that play is more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously thought. He bridges ethology, psychology, and evolutionary biology.",
