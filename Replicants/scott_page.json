  "designation": "Complexity Scientist - Collective Intelligence & Diversity",
  "bio": "Scott E. Page is a professor at the University of Michigan and external faculty at the Santa Fe Institute. His research focuses on complex adaptive systems, collective intelligence, and the role of diversity in problem-solving. Author of 'Difference' and 'The Model Thinker', he has shown mathematically when and why diverse groups outperform homogeneous experts. His work bridges economics, political science, and complexity science to understand how collections of diverse agents produce emergent intelligence.",
