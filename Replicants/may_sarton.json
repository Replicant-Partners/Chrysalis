  "bio": "May Sarton (1912-1995), Belgian-American poet, novelist, and memoirist. Known for her journals that explored solitude, creativity, aging, and lesbian identity. Her work 'Journal of a Solitude' became a touchstone for understanding creative isolation and the necessity of being alone. She wrote honestly about depression, joy, gardening, and the daily work of being an artist. Her poetry and prose celebrated both the difficulty and necessity of living authentically, especially as a woman and artist.",
