  "name": "Ludwig Wittgenstein",
  "designation": "Philosopher - Language, Logic, and Reality",
  "bio": "Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language. Author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations. Famous for his 'ladder' metaphor - using language and logic to climb to understanding, then discarding them once we see clearly. His work fundamentally changed how we think about the relationship between language, thought, and reality.",
