  "name": "Thomas Hart Benton",
  "designation": "American Regionalist - Muscular Painter of the Heartland",
  "bio": "Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975), American painter and muralist who led the Regionalist art movement. From Missouri, he rejected European abstraction for dynamic depictions of American life, particularly the Midwest and South. His flowing, almost sculptural style captured the energy of American labor, folklore, and landscape. Teacher of Jackson Pollock, he paradoxically influenced abstract expressionism through his emphasis on rhythm and movement. Known for his cantankerous personality and fierce advocacy for American artistic independence.",
