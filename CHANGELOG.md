## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Adaptive Pattern Resolver**: Context-aware selection of pattern implementations (MCP vs embedded)
- **Embedding Service**: Infrastructure for semantic similarity (ready for @xenova/transformers)
- **Enhanced Memory Merger**: Configurable similarity methods (Jaccard or embedding)
- **Fractal Architecture**: Formalized pattern composition across 5 scales
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: 18 documents with rigorous analysis
- **Documentation Reorganization**: Clean structure (docs/{current,research,archive})

### Changed
- Memory similarity now configurable (backward compatible, Jaccard default)
- Specifications use precise terminology (honest gap assessment)
- Documentation structure reorganized for clarity and professionalism

### Research
- Standards-mode rigor applied (evidence-based, single-step inference)
- Layer 1 MCP servers reviewed and integrated into architecture
- Memory system evolution path specified (4 phases)

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- 10 universal patterns from distributed systems research
- MCP Layer 1 fabric (cryptographic-primitives, distributed-structures)
- Pattern implementations (Hash, Signature, Byzantine, Time)
- Enhanced security architecture (multi-layer defense)
- Deep research integration (150+ pages)

### Research
- Universal patterns identified and validated
- Mathematical foundations documented
- Security attacks analyzed with defenses
- Gossip protocols researched

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- Three agent types (MCP, Multi-Agent, Orchestrated)
- Experience sync protocols (Streaming, Lumped, Check-in)
- Memory/Skill/Knowledge merging
- Instance management with health monitoring
- Dual-coded memory (episodic + semantic)

### Changed
- Expanded from two-way (ElizaOS ↔ CrewAI) to universal morphing
- Added experience accumulation from deployed instances

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- Shadow field encryption for information preservation
- Basic cryptographic identity
- Framework adapters

### Foundation
- Proof of concept for lossless conversion
- Shadow data approach validated

---
