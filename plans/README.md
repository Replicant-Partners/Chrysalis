## Creating New Plans

When creating a new plan:

1. **Use Clear Naming**: `COMPONENT_FEATURE_PLAN.md` or descriptive hyphenated names
2. **Include Metadata**:
   - Status (Active/In Progress/Blocked/Research/Specification)
   - Purpose
   - Owner (optional)
   - Timeline (optional)
3. **Structure**:
   - Overview
   - Goals
   - Implementation phases
   - Success criteria
4. **Update This README**: Add entry to Current Plans table

## Archiving Plans

When a plan is completed or superseded:

1. Move to `docs/archive/` (flat structure)
2. Update [docs/archive/README.md](../docs/archive/README.md) index
3. Remove from this README's Current Plans table
4. Add note to Recently Archived section (remove after next archive batch)
5. Update any cross-references
