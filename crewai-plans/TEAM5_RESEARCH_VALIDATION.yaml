  # ===== Research Scientist Tasks =====
  
  - id: "TASK-5.1.1"
    description: |
      Conduct comprehensive comparative evaluation of Chrysalis vs other
      agent frameworks:
      
      Frameworks to Compare:
      1. LangChain (agent + memory)
      2. AutoGPT (autonomous agents)
      3. CrewAI (native, no Chrysalis)
      4. Chrysalis (with Chrysalis transformations)
      
      Evaluation Dimensions:
      
      A. Persistence:
         - Does agent state persist across process restarts?
         - Is memory searchable semantically?
         - Is evolution tracked historically?
         - Measure: Setup time, memory capacity, search performance
      
      B. Morphing/Interoperability:
         - Can agents transform between frameworks?
         - Is information preserved (lossless)?
         - Measure: Conversion time, information loss (should be 0%)
      
      C. Security:
         - Cryptographic identity?
         - Byzantine resistance?
         - Audit logging?
         - Measure: Attack resistance, identity verification cost
      
      D. Performance:
         - Agent creation time
         - Operation latency (p50, p95, p99)
         - Memory footprint
         - Throughput (operations per second)
      
      E. Usability:
         - Setup time (from zero to working agent)
         - API complexity (lines of code for common operations)
         - Documentation quality (measured by user study)
      
      Methodology:
      - Controlled experiments (same hardware, same tasks)
      - Statistical significance (t-tests, n=30 runs minimum)
      - Reproducibility package (scripts, data, results)
      - Honest assessment (pros and cons for each)
      
      Expected Result: Chrysalis excels in persistence, security, and
      morphing; may be comparable or slightly behind in raw performance;
      may have higher initial complexity (setup time).
