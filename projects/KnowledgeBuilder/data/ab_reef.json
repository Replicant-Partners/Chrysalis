Other threats include shipping accidents, [oil spills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill), and tropical cyclones.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-CRC46-60) [Skeletal Eroding Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_Eroding_Band), a disease of bony corals caused by the [protozoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoan) _[Halofolliculina corallasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halofolliculina_corallasia)_, affects 31 coral species.[\\[61\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-61) According to a 2012 study by the [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences), since 1985, the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals with two-thirds of the loss occurring from 1998 due to the factors listed before.[\\[62\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-62) In 2022, the northern and central parts of the reef had the highest amount of coral cover since monitoring began, but the cover in the southern part had decreased and bleaching events occurred more frequently.[\\[63\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-63)\n\n### Climate change\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing [ocean warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_warming) which increases [coral bleaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching).[\\[64\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-64)[\\[65\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-65) Mass coral bleaching events due to [marine heatwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_heatwave) occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2020,[\\[66\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-66)[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:1-13)[\\[67\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:2-67) and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence.[\\[68\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-tele-68) In 2020, a study found that the Great Barrier Reef has lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.[\\[67\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:2-67)[\\[69\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-69) As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures. Coral bleaching events lead to increased disease susceptibility, which causes detrimental ecological effects for reef communities.[\\[70\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Littman-70)\n\nIn July 2017 [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) published in a draft decision, expressing serious concern about the impact of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. The draft decision also warned Australia that it will not meet the targets of the Reef 2050 report without considerable work to improve water quality.[\\[71\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-71)\n\nClimate change has implications for other forms of reef life\u00a0\u2013 some fish's preferred temperature range leads them to seek new habitat, thus increasing chick mortality in predatory seabirds. Climate change will also affect the sea turtle's population and available habitat.[\\[72\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-GBRMPAclimatechange-72)\n\nBleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than 20 metres or 66 feet) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress.[\\[73\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Schmidt-73)\n\n### Ocean Acidification\n\nA threat for the Great Barrier Reef is the rising levels of [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification). Ocean acidification occurs when excess atmospheric carbon dioxide gets absorbed into the ocean. This causes a decrease in the pH and this alters the chemistry of the ocean's water. This reduces the amount of aragonite, a key mineral for coral to grow, in the water. The Great Barrier Reef is predicted to lose aragonite at a rate of about 0.1 per decade this century.[\\[74\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-74) The acidic water breaks down the materials that coral and shell building creatures need to grow.[\\[75\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-75)\n\n### Pollution\n\nAnother key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_pollution) and declining [water quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution). The rivers of north-eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm [runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff).[\\[76\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-76) 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to [overgrazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing), increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including [fertilisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertiliser), [herbicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide) and [pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide) representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Human_Impact_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef-77)\n\nAccording to a 2016 report, while higher regulation contributes to less overall pollution from \"other land uses, such as industrial, mining, port development, dredging and urban development\", these can still be locally significant.[\\[78\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-78) Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the [Ok Tedi Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ok_Tedi_Mine) in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and [Torres Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait) regions.[\\[79\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-79) Some 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said.[\\[80\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-80)\n\n#### Loss of coastal wetland\n\nThe runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal [wetlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland) which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment.[\\[81\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-wetlands-81)[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Brodie07-82)[\\[83\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-83) It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen [competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology)) from [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae).[\\[84\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-waterquality-84)\n\n#### Eutrophication\n\nFarming fertiliser runoff release [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen), [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus), and [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium) into the oceanic ecosystem, and these [limiting nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_nutrient) cause massive algal growth which eventually leads to a reduction in oxygen available for other creatures in a process called [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication). This decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the [species composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_composition). A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of [Australian Institute of Marine Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Marine_Science) found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Human_Impact_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef-77)\n\nFertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Human_Impact_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef-77)\n\n#### Sediment runoff\n\nSediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Human_Impact_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef-77)\n\n#### Pesticides\n\nPesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Human_Impact_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef-77)\n\n#### Pollution from mining\n\nMining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water. The [Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park_Authority) (GBRMPA) stated \"We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed\".[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Clive_Palmer's_nickel_refinery_pumped_toxic_waste_into_Great_Barrier_Reef_park-85)\n\n### Crown of thorns\n\n[Crown-of-thorns starfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-of-thorns_starfish)\n\nThe [crown-of-thorns starfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-of-thorns_starfish) preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the Reef Research Centre (RRC).[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-cots_1999-2000-86) Outbreaks are believed to occur in natural cycles, worsened by poor water quality and overfishing of the starfish's predators.[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-cots_1999-2000-86)[\\[87\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-87)\n\n### Overfishing\n\nThe unsustainable [overfishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing) of [keystone species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species), such as the [giant Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(mollusk)), can disrupt [food chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain) vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, [by-catch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-catch) of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and [habitat destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction) from [trawling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trawling), [anchors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchors) and nets.[\\[88\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-88) As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [Great Barrier Reef Marine Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park) is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.[\\[89\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-89)\n\nThe _[Shen Neng\u00a01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Neng_1)_ aground on the Great Barrier Reef, 5 April 2010\n\n### Shipping\n\nShipping accidents are a pressing concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[90\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-GBRMPAshipping-90)\nAlthough the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-reefdoco-91) There have been over 1,600\u00a0known shipwrecks in the Great Barrier Reef region.[\\[92\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-92)\nOn 3 April 2010, the [bulk coal carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier) [_Shen Neng\u00a01_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jia_Yong) ran aground on Douglas Shoals,[\\[93\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-93) [spilling up to four tonnes of oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Great_Barrier_Reef_oil_spill) into the water and causing extensive damage to the reef.[\\[94\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-94)\n\n### Shark culling\n\nMain article: [Shark culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_culling)\n\nThe government of [Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland) has a \"shark control\" program ( [shark culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_culling)) that deliberately kills sharks throughout Queensland, including in the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[95\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-shark_culling-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ntd-96) Environmentalists\\[ _[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions)_\\] and scientists\\[ _[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)_\\] say that this program harms the [marine ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem); they also say it is \"outdated, cruel and ineffective\".[\\[96\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ntd-96) The Queensland \"shark control\" program uses [shark nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_nets) and [drum lines with baited hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_line_(shark_control)) to kill sharks in the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 there are 173 lethal drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[95\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-shark_culling-95)[\\[96\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ntd-96)[\\[97\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-maritime-97) In Queensland, sharks found alive on the baited hooks are shot.[\\[98\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-98) Queensland's \"shark control\" program killed about 50,000 sharks from 1962 to 2018.[\\[99\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-99) Also, Queensland's \"shark control\" program has also killed many other animals (such as [dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins) and [turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles))\u00a0\u2013 the program killed 84,000 marine animals from 1962 to 2015, including in the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[100\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-100) In 2018, [Humane Society International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_International) filed a lawsuit against the government of Queensland to stop shark culling in the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[97\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-maritime-97)\n\n## Protection and preservation: Reef 2050 plan\n\nFurther information: [Natural Heritage Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Heritage_Trust)\n\nIn March 2015, the Australian and [Queensland's governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Queensland) formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef's universal heritage until 2050. This 35-year plan, titled \"Reef 2050 Plan\" is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life-span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050.[\\[101\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-101)\n\nHowever, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration and killing predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause of the problem \u2013 climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment.[\\[71\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:0-71)[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-102)[\\[103\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-103) Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with[\\[104\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-104)) is very limited.[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-105)\n\nAs part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443\u00a0million grant was given to the [Great Barrier Reef Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Foundation) in 2018. The announcement of the grant was subject to backlash as the grant had avoided proper tender and transparency processes.\n\n### Conservation Policy: Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef contributes to the overall wellbeing of the marine biome.[\\[106\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-106) Numerous species of aquatic plants, fish and megafauna use the reef for feeding, shelter and mating.[\\[107\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-107) Threats such as [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification), pollution runoff and outbreaks of destructive species like the [crown-of-thorns starfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-of-thorns_starfish) have brought about the decline of this ecosystem.[\\[108\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-108) These threats to the reef are not only a danger to the organisms inhabiting it, but also the economy of this region, a large part of which relies on revenue from ecotourism of the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[109\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-109)\n\nThe [Australian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government) has had the goal of protecting this World Heritage Site since 1972 when they created The Australian Institute of Marine Science.[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:02-110) The Australian and Queensland governments have contributed about $142.5 million to their National Environmental Science Program which is how they've collected much of their data regarding threats to the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:02-110) In addition, the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan was announced in 2018 in order to help transition local communities, agricultural organizations and industries to more sustainable practices.[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:3-111) This plan will join the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the amounts of runoff that reach the Great Barrier Reef as well as mitigating crown-of-thorns starfish population flare-ups.[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-:3-111)\n\n## Human use\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the [Aboriginal Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australian) and [Torres Strait Islander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander) peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years,[\\[112\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-112) and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago.[\\[113\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-113) For these 70 or so [clan groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_group), the reef is also an important cultural feature.[\\[114\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-traditionalfishing-114)\n\nIn 1768, [Louis de Bougainville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Bougainville) encountered the reef, but did not explore it.[\\[115\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-115) On 11 June 1770, [HM Bark\u00a0_Endeavour_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour), captained by explorer [James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook), ran [aground](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aground) on the Great Barrier Reef, sustaining considerable damage. Lightening the ship and re-floating it during an incoming tide eventually saved it.[\\[116\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-cook-116) One of the most famous wrecks was [HMS\u00a0_Pandora_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Pandora_(1779)), which sank on 29 August 1791, killing 35 men.

A combination of [zoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning), management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [eco-tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-tourism) certification) are employed in the effort to conserve the reef.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-CRC46-60)[\\[120\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-120)\n\nIn 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act), which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.\n\nThere are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of [marine protected areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_protected_area)\", also known as just \"the Guidelines\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.\n\nThe priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.[\\[121\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Marine_Bioregional_Planning_Process-121)\n\nIn 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[122\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-122) The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, [algal blooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom), and [pesticide pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_pollution). These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.\n\nWhen the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.\n\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan\u00a05)\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.\n\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat [sediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment) loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.\n\nA taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.\n\nSome examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.\n\nThrough these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.[\\[123\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-WQ_protection_plan-123)\n\nA blue starfish ( _[Linckia laevigata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linckia_laevigata)_) resting on hard _[Acropora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropora)_ and _[Porites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porites)_ corals\n\nIn July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for [marine ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem) conservation.[\\[124\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-124) The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using [marxan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxan) software.[\\[125\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-125) While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.[\\[126\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-126) At the time, it was the largest [Marine Protected Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Protected_Area) in the world, although in 2006, the new [Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Hawaiian_Islands_National_Monument) became the largest.[\\[127\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-BBC_5083974-127)\n\nIn 2006, a review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975 recommended that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) outlook report should be published, examining the reef's health, management, and environmental pressures.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1975review-5)[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-128) In each outlook report, several assessments are required. Each assessment has a set of assessment criteria that allows for better presentation of available evidence. Each assessment is judged by these criteria and given a grade. Every outlook report follows the same judging and grading process so that information can be tracked over time. No new research is done to produce the report. Only readily available information goes into the report so little of what is known about the Reef is actually featured in each outlook report.[\\[129\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-129)\n\n#### Abbot Point coal port dredge dumping controversy\n\nIn December 2013, [Greg Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt), the [Australian environment minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_the_Environment_(Australia)), approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3\u00a0million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.[\\[130\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-130)\n\nOn 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from [Abbot Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Point), north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80\u00a0km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Spoil-131)\n\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15\u00a0mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4\u00a0billion and $2.8\u00a0billion.[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Spoil-131) Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\n\n> This approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. It's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Spoil-131)\n\nThe approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:\n\n- A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed.\n- A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay.\n- The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives.[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Spoil-131)[\\[132\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Marine_Parks_dredge_dumping_permit-132)\n\nThe Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land.[\\[133\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-133)\n\n### Tourism\n\nMain article: [Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef)\n\nA [scuba diver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving) looking at a [giant clam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_clam) on the Great Barrier ReefHelicopter view of the reef and boats\n\nDue to its vast [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity), warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called \" [live aboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_aboard)\", the reef is a very popular destination, especially for [scuba divers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving).

These areas make up 7\u20138% of the park's area.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-CRC46-60) The Whitsundays and [Cairns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns) have their own Plans of Management.[\\[134\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2005Brochure-134) Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now [resorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort), including [Green Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Island_(Queensland)) and [Lady Elliot Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Elliot_Island). As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-CRC46-60)\n\nIn 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed [A$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar) 776\u00a0million per annum.[\\[135\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-135) As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4\u00a0billion annually,[\\[136\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-136) and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1\u00a0billion.[\\[134\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2005Brochure-134) A [Deloitte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte) report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef's 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4\u00a0billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people.[\\[137\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-137)\n\nApproximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.[\\[138\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-138) Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine Tourism industry, there is a concern among the general public that tourism is harmful to the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-CRC46-60)\n\nA variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from [dinghies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghies) to [superyachts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superyacht).[\\[139\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-139) [Glass-bottomed boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_bottom_boat) and underwater [observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory) are also popular, as are [helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter) flights.[\\[140\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-140)[\\[141\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-141) By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are [snorkelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorkelling) and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\\]\n\nManagement of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [ecologically sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_sustainability). A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[134\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2005Brochure-134) This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.[\\[142\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-142)\nPolicies on [cruise ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship), [bareboat charters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareboat_charter), and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.[\\[134\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2005Brochure-134)\n\nThe problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often [DDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT) and [mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)), which cause [aspergillosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis), [yellow-band disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-band_disease), and [black band disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_band_disease). Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals.[\\[143\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-143) Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.[\\[144\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-144)\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem.\\[ _[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\\]\n\n### Fishing\n\nThe [fishing industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry) in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [A$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar) 1\u00a0billion annually.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-economics-15) It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.[\\[114\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-traditionalfishing-114)\n\n### Dugong hunting\n\nUnder the [Native Title Act 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title_Act_1993), native title holders [retain the right to legally hunt dugongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong_hunting_in_Australia) and [green turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_turtle) for \"personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs\".[\\[145\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-145)\\[ _[unreliable source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)_\\]\n\nFour [traditional owners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_owners) groups agreed to cease the hunting of [dugongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong) in the area in 2011 due to their declining numbers, partially accelerated by seagrass damage from [Cyclone Yasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Yasi).[\\[146\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-146)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Australia portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Australia)\n- [Queensland portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Queensland)\n- [Oceania portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Oceania)\n- [Islands portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Islands)\n- [Marine life portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Marine_life)\n\n- [Catlin Seaview Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catlin_Seaview_Survey)\n- [Coral Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle)\n- [Gal\u00e1pagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands)\n- [Great Barrier Reef Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Committee) (1922\u20131982)\n- [Great Southern Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Southern_Reef)\n- [Islands on the Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Islands_on_the_Great_Barrier_Reef)\n- [Komodo National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_National_Park)\n- [List of reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reefs)\n- [Ocean acidification in the Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification_in_the_Great_Barrier_Reef)\n- [Sixth extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_extinction)\n- [Valdes Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdes_Peninsula)\n\n## References\n\n001. ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_ref-UNEP_1-0) [_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_ref-UNEP_1-1)UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (1980).

Het Groot barri\u00e8rerif is ook van groot wetenschappelijk belang als habitat van diersoorten als de dugong ('zeekoe') en de grote groene schildpad, die met uitsterven worden bedreigd.\n\nSource: [unesco.nl](http://unesco.nl/erfgoed/groot-barriererif)\n\n- [English](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_en)\n- [French](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_fr)\n- [Arabic](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_ar)\n- [Chinese](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_zh)\n- [Russian](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_ru)\n- [Spanish](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_es)\n- [Japanese](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_ja)\n- [Dutch](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154#contentdes_nl)\n\n[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0001-750-750-20151104132153.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)\n\n[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0021-40-40-20161018103211.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0022-40-40-20161018103212.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0023-40-40-20161018103212.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0024-40-40-20161018103213.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0025-40-40-20161018103213.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0026-40-40-20161018103214.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0027-40-40-20161018103214.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0028-40-40-20161018103215.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0029-40-40-20161018103216.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)[![](https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0154_0030-40-40-20161018103216.jpg)](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/gallery/)\n\n##### Outstanding Universal Value\n\n**Brief synthesis**\n\nAs the world\u2019s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, the Great Barrier Reef is a globally outstanding and significant entity. Practically the entire ecosystem was inscribed as World Heritage in 1981, covering an area of 348,000 square kilometres and extending across a contiguous latitudinal range of 14o (10oS to 24oS). The Great Barrier Reef (hereafter referred to as GBR) includes extensive cross-shelf diversity, stretching from the low water mark along the mainland coast up to 250 kilometres offshore. This wide depth range includes vast shallow inshore areas, mid-shelf and outer reefs, and beyond the continental shelf to oceanic waters over 2,000 metres deep.\n\nWithin the GBR there are some 2,500 individual reefs of varying sizes and shapes, and over 900 islands, ranging from small sandy cays and larger vegetated cays, to large rugged continental islands rising, in one instance, over 1,100\u00a0metres above sea level. Collectively these landscapes and seascapes provide some of the most spectacular maritime scenery in the world.\n\nThe latitudinal and cross-shelf diversity, combined with diversity through the depths of the water column, encompasses a globally unique array of ecological communities, habitats and species. This diversity of species and habitats, and their interconnectivity, make the GBR one of the richest and most complex natural ecosystems on earth. There are over 1,500 species of fish, about 400 species of coral, 4,000 species of mollusk, and some 240 species of birds, plus a great diversity of sponges, anemones, marine worms, crustaceans, and other species. No other World Heritage property contains such biodiversity. This diversity, especially the endemic species, means the GBR is of enormous scientific and intrinsic importance, and it also contains a significant number of threatened species. Attime of inscription, the IUCN evaluation stated \"\u2026 if only one coral reef site in the world were to be chosen for the World Heritage List, the Great Barrier Reef is the site to be chosen\".\n\n**Criterion (vii):** The GBR is of superlative natural beauty above and below the water, and provides some of the most spectacular scenery on earth. It is one of a few living structures visible from space, appearing as a complex string of reefal structures along Australia's northeast coast.\n\nFrom the air, the vast mosaic patterns of reefs, islands and coral cays produce an unparalleled aerial panorama of seascapes comprising diverse shapes and sizes. The Whitsunday Islands provide a magnificent vista of green vegetated islands and spectacular sandy beaches spread over azure waters. This contrasts with the vast mangrove forests in Hinchinbrook Channel, and the rugged vegetated mountains and lush rainforest gullies that are periodically cloud-covered on Hinchinbrook Island.\n\nOn many of the cays there are spectacular and globally important breeding colonies of seabirds and marine turtles, and Raine Island is the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding area. On some continental islands, large aggregations of over-wintering butterflies periodically occur.\n\nBeneath the ocean surface, there is an abundance and diversity of shapes, sizes and colours; for example, spectacular coral assemblages of hard and soft corals, and thousands of species of reef fish provide a myriad of brilliant colours, shapes and sizes. The internationally renowned Cod Hole near Lizard Island is one of many significant tourist attractions. Other superlative natural phenomena include the annual coral spawning, migrating whales, nesting turtles, and significant spawning aggregations of many fish species.\n\n**Criterion (viii):** The GBR, extending 2,000 kilometres along Queensland's coast, is a globally outstanding example of an ecosystem that has evolved over millennia. The area has been exposed and flooded by at least four glacial and interglacial cycles, and over the past 15,000 years reefs have grown on the continental shelf.\n\nDuring glacial periods, sea levels dropped, exposing the reefs as flat-topped hills of eroded limestone. Large rivers meandered between these hills and the coastline extended further east. During interglacial periods, rising sea levels caused the formation of continental islands, coral cays and new phases of coral growth. This environmental history can be seen in cores of old massive corals.\n\nToday the GBR forms the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem, ranging from inshore fringing reefs to mid-shelf reefs, and exposed outer reefs, including examples of all stages of reef development. The processes of geological and geomorphological evolution are well represented, linking continental islands, coral cays and reefs. The varied seascapes and landscapes that occur today have been moulded by changing climates and sea levels, and the erosive power of wind and water, over long time periods.\n\nOne-third of the GBR lies beyond the seaward edge of the shallower reefs; this area comprises continental slope and deep oceanic waters and abyssal plains.\n\n**Criterion (ix):** The globally significant diversity of reef and island morphologies reflects ongoing geomorphic, oceanographic and environmental processes. The complex cross-shelf, longshore and vertical connectivity is influenced by dynamic oceanic currents and ongoing ecological processes such as upwellings, larval dispersal and migration.\n\nOngoing erosion and accretion of coral reefs, sand banks and coral cays combine with similar processes along the coast and around continental islands. Extensive beds of Halimeda algae represent active calcification and accretion over thousands of years.\n\nBiologically the unique diversity of the GBR reflects the maturity of an ecosystem that has evolved over millennia; evidence exists for the evolution of hard corals and other fauna. Globally significant marine faunal groups include over 4,000 species of molluscs, over 1,500 species of fish, plus a great diversity of sponges, anemones, marine worms, crustaceans, and many others. The establishment of vegetation on the cays and continental islands exemplifies the important role of birds, such as the Pied Imperial Pigeon, in processes such as seed dispersal and plant colonisation.\n\nHuman interaction with the natural environment is illustrated by strong ongoing links between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their sea-country, and includes numerous shell deposits (middens) and fish traps, plus the application of story places and marine totems.\n\n**Criterion (x):** The enormous size and diversity of the GBR means it is one of the richest and most complex natural ecosystems on earth, and one of the most significant for biodiversity conservation. The amazing diversity supports tens of thousands of marine and terrestrial species, many of which are of global conservation significance.\n\nAs the world's most complex expanse of coral reefs, the reefs contain some 400 species of corals in 60 genera. There are also large ecologically important inter-reefal areas. The shallower marine areas support half the world's diversity of mangroves and many seagrass species. The waters also provide major feeding grounds for one of the world's largest populations of the threatened dugong. At least 30 species of whales and dolphins occur here, and it is a significant area for humpback whale calving.\n\nSix of the world\u2019s seven species of marine turtle occur in the GBR. As well as the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding site at Raine Island, the GBR also includes many regionally important marine turtle rookeries.\n\nSome 242 species of birds have been recorded in the GBR. Twenty-two seabird species breed on cays and some continental islands, and some of these breeding sites are globally significant; other seabird species also utilize the area. The continental islands support thousands of plant species, while the coral cays also have their own distinct flora and fauna.\n\n**Integrity**\n\nThe ecological integrity of the GBR is enhanced by the unparalleled size and current good state of conservation across the property. At the time of inscription it was felt that to include virtually the entire Great Barrier Reef within the property was the only way to ensure the integrity of the coral reef ecosystems in all their diversity.\n\nA number of natural pressures occur, including cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and sudden large influxes of freshwater from extreme weather events. As well there is a range of human uses such as tourism, shipping and coastal developments including ports. There are also some disturbances facing the GBR that are legacies of past actions prior to the inscription of the property on the World Heritage list.\n\nAt the scale of the GBR ecosystem, most habitats or species groups have the capacity to recover from disturbance or withstand ongoing pressures. The property is largely intact and includes the fullest possible representation of marine ecological, physical and chemical processes from the coast to the deep abyssal waters enabling the key interdependent elements to exist in their natural relationships.\n\nSome of the key ecological, physical and chemical processes that are essential for the long-term conservation of the marine and island ecosystems and their associated biodiversity occur outside the boundaries of the property and thus effective conservation programs are essential across the adjoining catchments, marine and coastal zones.\n\n**Protection and management requirements**\n\nThe GBR covers approximately 348,000 square kilometres.\u00a0 Most of the property lies within the GBR Marine Park: at 344,400 square kilometres, this Federal Marine Park comprises approximately 99% of the property. The GBR Marine Park's legal jurisdiction ends at low water mark along the mainland (with the exception of port areas) and around islands (with the exception of 70 Commonwealth managed islands which are part of the Marine Park).\u00a0 In addition the GBR also includes over 900 islands within the jurisdiction of Queensland, about half of which are declared as 'national parks', and the internal waters of Queensland that occur within the World Heritage boundary (including a number of long-established port areas).\n\nThe World Heritage property is and has always been managed as a multiple-use area.\u00a0 Uses include a range of commercial and recreational activities. The management of such a large and iconic world heritage property is made more complex due to the overlapping State and Federal jurisdictions. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an independent Australian Government agency, is responsible for protection and management of the GBR Marine Park.\u00a0 The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 was amended in 2007 and 2008, and now provides for \u201cthe long term protection and conservation ... of the Great Barrier Reef Region\u201d with specific mention of meeting \"... Australia's responsibilities under the World Heritage Convention\".\n\nQueensland is responsible for management of the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park, established under the Marine Parks Act 2004 (Qld). This is contiguous with the GBR Marine Park and covers the area between low and high water marks and many of the waters within the jurisdictional limits of Queensland. Queensland is also responsible for management of most of the islands.\n\nThe overlapping jurisdictional arrangements mean that the importance of complementary legislation and complementary management of islands and the surrounding waters is well recognised by both governments. Strong cooperative partnerships and formal agreements exist between the Australian Government and the Queensland Government. In addition, strong relationships have been built between governments and commercial and recreational industries, research institutions and universities. Collectively this provides a comprehensive management influence over a much wider context than just the marine areas and islands.\n\nDevelopment and land use activities in coastal and water catchments adjacent to the property also have a fundamental and critical influence on the values within the property.\u00a0 The Queensland Government is responsible for natural resource management and land use planning for the islands, coast and hinterland adjacent to the GBR. Other Queensland and Federal legislation also protects the property\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value addressing such matters as water quality, shipping management, sea dumping, fisheries management and environmental protection.\n\nThe Federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) provides an overarching mechanism for protecting the World Heritage values from inappropriate development, including actions taken inside or outside which could impact on its heritage values. This requires any development proposals to undergo rigorous environmental impact assessment processes, often including public consultation, after which the Federal Minister may decide, to approve, reject or approve under conditions designed to mitigate any significant impacts. A recent amendment to the EPBC Act makes the GBR Marine Park an additional 'trigger' for a matter of National Environmental Significance which provides additional protection for the values within the GBR.\n\nThe GBR Marine Park and the adjoining GBR Coast Marine Park are zoned to allow for a wide range of reasonable uses while ensuring overall protection, with conservation being the primary aim. The zoning spectrum provides for increasing levels of protection for the 'core conservation areas' which comprise the 115,000 square kilometres of \u2018no-take\u2019 and \u2018no-entry\u2019 zones within the GBR.\n\nWhile the Zoning Plan is the 'cornerstone' of management and provides a spatial basis for determining where many activities can occur, zoning is only one of many spatial management tools and policies applied to collectively protect the GBR. Some activities are better managed using other spatial and temporal management tools like Plans of Management, Special Management Areas, Agreements with Traditional Owners and permits (often tied to specific zones or smaller areas within zones, but providing a detailed level of management not possible by zoning alone). These statutory instruments also protect the Outstanding Universal Value of the property.\n\nMany Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples undertake traditional use of marine resource activities to provide traditional food, practice their living maritime culture, and to educate younger generations about traditional and cultural rules and protocols.\u00a0 In the GBR these activities are managed under both Federal and Queensland legislation and policies including Traditional Use of Marine Resource Agreements (TUMRAs) and Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs).\u00a0 These currently cover some 30 per cent of the GBR inshore area, and support Traditional Owners to maintain cultural connections with their sea country.\n\nSimilarly non-statutory tools like site management and Industry Codes of Practice contribute to the protection of World Heritage values. Some spatial management tools are not permanently in place nor appear as part of the zoning, yet achieve effective protection for elements of biodiversity (e.g. the temporal closures that are legislated across the GBR prohibit all reef fishing during specific moon phases when reef fish are spawning).\n\nOther key initiatives providing increased protection for the GBR include thecomprehensive Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report (and its resulting 5-yearly reporting process); the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan; the GBR Climate Change Action Plan; and the Reef Guardians Stewardship Programs which involve building relationships and working closely with those who use and rely on the GBR or its catchment for their recreation or their business.\n\nThe 2009 Outlook Report identified the long-term challenges facing the GBR; these are dominated by climate change over the next few decades. The extent and persistence of damage to the GBR ecosystem will depend to a large degree on the amount of change in the world\u2019s climate and on the resilience of the GBR ecosystem to such change. This report also identified continued declining water quality from land-based sources, loss of coastal habitats from coastal development, and some impacts from fishing, illegal fishing and poaching as the other priority issues requiring management attention for the long-term protection of the GBR.\n\nEmerging issues since the 2009 Outlook Report include proposed port expansions, increases in shipping activity, coastal development and intensification and changes in land use within the GBR catchment; population growth; the impacts from marine debris; illegal activities; and extreme weather events including floods and cyclones.\n\nFurther building the resilience of the GBR by improving water quality, reducing the loss of coastal habitats and increasing knowledge about fishing and its effects and encouraging modified practices, will give the GBR its best chance of adapting to and recovering from the threats ahead, including the impacts of a changing climate.\n\n##### Links\n\n-

        "snippet": "# **Geography of the\u00a0Great Barrier Reef**\n\nListen to this article\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef\n\n2:50\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system, stretching for over 1,400 miles along Australia\u2019s northeastern coast. It\u2019s an incredible natural wonder, made up of nearly 3,000\u00a0separate reefs and 900 islands. This huge reef is famous for its stunning marine life and its importance to the environment.\n\nLocated in the Coral Sea, just off the coast of Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef runs from the northern tip of the state all the way down to just north of Bundaberg.\n\nIt\u2019s made up of many different types of coral reefs, like fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. These reefs are built by tiny marine animals called coral polyps. Over thousands of years, these creatures produce a hard material called calcium carbonate, which forms the solid structures of the reef.\n\nThe reef is home to a wide range of habitats, from shallow lagoons to deep ocean waters, and supports an amazing variety of sea life. There are over 1,500 species of fish, 411 types of hard coral, and many other animals like sea turtles, seabirds, and a few different types of sharks including\u00a0white tip and black tip reef sharks.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef plays a huge role in the ocean's ecosystem. Coral reefs provide food, shelter, and breeding grounds for countless marine animals.\n\nWithout these reefs, many sea creatures wouldn\u2019t have a place to live or find food. Almost half of the world's oxygen comes from coral reefs. The reef helps balance the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is important for the health of our planet.\n\nFor thousands of years, indigenous Australians have lived in harmony with the reef, and it holds deep cultural and spiritual meaning for them. Economically, the Great Barrier Reef is a major part of Australia\u2019s economy. Millions of tourists visit every year to snorkel, dive, and explore the reef, bringing in billions of dollars and supporting jobs in tourism and fishing.\n\nUnfortunately, the Great Barrier Reef faces serious threats, many caused by humans.\n\nThe biggest threat is climate change, which is warming the ocean and causing coral bleaching. This happens when corals lose the algae that live in their tissues. The coral\u00a0loses its vibrant colors and turns\u00a0white, making it more vulnerable to disease.\n\nPollution from farms and coastal development is another big problem, as it lowers water quality and can smother corals. Overfishing and harmful tourism practices also put stress on the reef\u2019s delicate ecosystem.\n\nThankfully, there are many efforts in place to protect the reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) manages the area, which has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981.\n\nConservation strategies include creating no-fishing zones to help marine life recover and improving farming practices to reduce pollution. Scientists are also working on ways to protect the reef from climate change, such as breeding corals that can handle warmer waters and restoring damaged coral reefs.\n\n[Back](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/australian-outback-geography)\n\n### [World Geography Textbook](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/world-geography-online-textbook)\n\n[Next](https://www.studentsofhistory.com/new-zealand-geography-culture)"

        "snippet": "\n \n \n \n \n \n AUSTRALIA \n This is the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem and one of the most complex and biodiverse natural systems on earth. The site has more than 2,900 coral reefs built of 359 species of hard coral; over 200,000 hectares of mangroves, with 54% of the world\u2019s mangrove species; over 300,000 hectares of sea grasses, 2,000 fish and 6 turtle species; 5,000-8,000 molluscs; one of the world\u2019s largest dugong populations; breeding grounds for humpback and other whales; and 2,195 species of native plants. \n COUNTRY \n Australia \n NAME \n Great Barrier Reef \n NATURAL WORLD HERITAGE SERIAL SITE \n 1981: Inscribed on the World Heritage List under Natural Criteria vii, viii, ix and x. \n STATEMENT OF OUTSTANDING UNIVERSAL VALUE [pending] \n INTERNATIONAL DESIGNATIONS \n 1993: Bowling Green Bay (35,500 ha) and \n 1996: Shoalwater and Corio Bays (239,100 ha) designated Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention \n IUCN MANAGEMENT CATEGORY \n Ia Strict Nature Reserve \n II National Park \n V Managed Resource Protected Area. \n The property encloses or abuts over 15 National Parks (category II) and several Habitat/Species Management Areas (category IV). \n BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PROVINCE \n Queensland Coastal (6.01.01) \n GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION \n The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area extends for some 2,300 km along the northeastern coast of Australia from a point level with the tip of the York Peninsula on the Torres Strait to just south of the Tropic of Capricorn. It extends beyond the low water mark 60 to 290 km from the coast, between 24\u00b030'N to 10\u00b041'S and 145\u00b000' to 154\u00b000'E. \n DATES AND HISTORY OF ESTABLISHMENT \n 1937 &amp; 1943: Parts of Green Island and Heron Island were gazetted as National Parks under the State Forests and National Parks Act of 1903/1948 (Queensland); \n 1974: Heron-Wistari and Green Island Marine Parks gazetted under the Forestry Act of 1959-1976 (Queensland) as the first Marine Parks on the reef; \n 1975: The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 provided for the establishment, control, care and development of a Marine Park covering 98.5% of the Great Barrier Reef Region as defined in that Act; \n 1976: The enacted powers were transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Act and Fisheries Act both of 1976; \n 1979: The Capricornia Section, the first section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMPA) proclaimed; \n 1981: The Cairns and Cormorant Pass sections declared part of the Marine Park. The remaining sections of the Marine Park were included between 1987 and 1989; \n 1990: Proclaimed a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) by the International Marine Organisation; extended in 2002 to Torres Strait. \n LAND TENURE \n Title to the seabed inside the three-mile territorial limit is vested in the State of Queensland by the Coastal Waters (State Title) Act of 1980 (Commonwealth of Australia). It is subject to reservations, primarily by the operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act of 1975. Exclusive rights to explore and exploit the seabed of the continental shelf beyond the territorial limit are vested in the Federal Government (Commonwealth) subject to some limited rights conferred on third parties. Within the Queensland limits, public title is vested in the State, apart from public lands owned by the Commonwealth. Some land is held privately (Kelleher et al., 1989). Islands off Queensland not covered by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act are not part of the Marine Park, but are included in the GBRMPA work program. \n AREA \n The World Heritage Area is 34,870,000 ha divided between four management areas: Far Northern (8,570,000 ha), Cairns-Cooktown (3,700,000 ha), Townsville-Whitsunday (7,693,000 ha) and Mackay-Capricorn (14,477,000 ha). The Marine Park area is 34,440,000 ha. It excludes Queensland-owned islands and internal waters plus areas excluded under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, all near the coast. \n ALTITUDE \n The average sea bed level is approximately 40m. The highest point is 1,121m on Hinchinbrook Island. \n The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 applies to areas between 1,000m below the sea bed to 915m above sea level. \n PHYSICAL FEATURES \n The property covers the most extensive coral reef ecosystem in the world, extending 2,300 km from warm temperate waters just south of the Tropic of Capricorn to tropical waters in the Torres Strait halfway to Papua New Guinea; and from the low water mark to between 60 and 320 km from the coast. The complete reef system extends to the Papua New Guinea coast. The area is largely open water but exceeds that of the states of Victoria and Tasmania combined. It comprises some 3,400 individual reefs, 2,900 within the Marine Park, including 760 fringing reefs, which range in size from under 1ha to over 10,000 ha in varying forms, and provide the most spectacular marine scenery on earth. There are some 300 coral cays, including 213 unvegetated cays, 43 vegetated cays and 44 low wooded islands. There are also 618 continental islands (GBRMPA, pers. comm., 1995). The reef is about 500,000 years old. \n The form and structure of the individual reefs show great variety. Two main classes can be defined: platform or patch reefs, resulting from radial growth; and wall reefs, resulting from elongated growth, often where there are strong water currents. There are also many fringing reefs where the reef growth is established on subtidal rocks of the mainland coast or continental islands (Kelleher et al., 1989). For example, the Capricorn-Bunker Group National Park encloses a terrestrial section of four islands: Fairfax Island, a coral cay of two small islands on an egg-shaped reef; Hoskyn Island similar to Fairfax, though not a cay; Heron Island, sand and broken coral on a coral and rock formation; and Lady Musgrave Island, a cay surrounded by extensive coral reefs. \n The water circulation is very complex, governed by the properties of the Coral Sea, land run-off, evaporation, the southeast trade winds, upwellings forced up by strong tidal currents through narrow reef passages, coastal waters and mangrove swamps. Tides are generally semi-diurnal with diurnal inequality towards the north, becoming almost diurnal in Torres Strait. The maximum tidal range is about 3m along most of the coast, although increasing to 6 to 9m in the area around Broad Sound between 21\u00b0 and 23\u00b0S. The water is vertically well-mixed for most of the year with stratification due to the freshwater inflow between January and April. 26 river catchments drain into the Park and freshwater run-off can have significant localised physical and biological effects (Kelleher et al., 1989). \n CLIMATE \n The Great Barrier Reef has a tropical climate influenced primarily by two features of the southern hemisphere circulation: the equatorial low pressure zone during the summer months and the sub-tropical high pressure zone during the winter months. The area lies between continental Australia and the open ocean of the South Pacific, and its climate is strongly influenced by both. The wind pattern for most of the year is dominated by the southeast trades, but from January to March, northwesterlies prevail over the north of the Reef under the influence of the inter-tropical monsoonal front. The rainfall is seasonally and geographically variable. The wettest period is summer, under the influence of the monsoon and irregular tropical cyclones and depressions. Heavy rain may occur in the south during winter. Air temperatures vary between an average maximum of about 30\u00b0C in January and 23\u00b0C in July and an average minimum of about 24\u00b0C in January and 18\u00b0C in July. The mean water surface temperature is highest during February and lowest during July (Kelleher et al., 1989). Climate warming has begun to threaten the reef as an increase of 1-2\u00b0C can be lethal to coral, which bleach on expelling their zooanthellae. There were notable bleaching episodes in 1998 and 2002, which reduced live coral cover from 25%-40% to 5% in places (Reef CRC, n.d.). The temperature in 2005 (1.1\u00b0C) was the highest recorded, exceeding the 30-year average. \n VEGETATION \n This is the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem with over 200,000 hectares of mangroves, and over 300,000 hectares of sea grasses. 4,000,000 hectares of lagoon are vegetated (Reef CRC, n.d.). There are 2,195 species of native plants, over a quarter of Queensland\u2019s species, of which three are endemic. 300-350 species are found on coral cays in the north, two being endemic, and 120 on cays in the south. The Whitsunday Islands have the highest diversity with 1,141 species. Some 70 species are nationally threatened or rare. Globally endangered plants include the orchid Habenaria divaricata (EN) and eight species listed as vulnerable. This is the southern limit for several pantropical species (GBRMPA, 2000). Island vegetation is dominated by Pisonia grandis as on Heron and Lady Musgrave islands at the southern end of the area. Forests of this tree thrive in the acidic guano produced by nesting seabirds. Nearby Hoskyn Island, with a forest of screw pine Pandanus tectorius with Pisonia and Ficus apposita, is unique to the group. Other vegetation includes the she-oak Casuarina equisetifolia, Indian mallow Abutilon indicum, Candia subcordata, poinsettia Euphorbia pulcherrima sp. and grasses such as Thuorna insula and Lepturus repens. \n There are 37 species of mangrove, 54% of the world\u2019s mangrove species. Fifteen species of sea grass grow throughout the area in inshore shallows. They are rarely abundant but are an important food source for grazing animals, especially dugong (Kelleher et al., 1989). Dominant species are Halophila ovalis, Halodule uninervis and Zostera capricornis (Reef CRC, n.d.). There are some 4-500 species of marine algae of every type, including 26 macroalgae and a recent invader from the north, the golden algae Chrysocystus fragilis, which blankets and kills coral. The wide range of fleshy algae, many of them small and inconspicuous, are highly productive and heavily grazed by turtles, fish, molluscs and sea urchins. The coralline algae are an important component of reef building. \n FAUNA \n The Reef is one of the most complex and biodiverse natural systems on earth, with more than 2,900 individual coral reefs built of 359 species of hard coral, covering between 25% to 40% of reef surfaces and 70 distinct biological subregions. There are recorded some 1,500 species of fish, including 49 pipefish and 9 seahorses (half the world\u2019s species), 6 turtles, 15 sea snakes (all of the Hydrophiidae) and 80 genera of octocorals (soft corals, sea fans and sea pens ). The immense diversity of marine life encompasses 5,000-8,000 species of mollusc. 630 echinoderms, 1,330 crustaceans, 6,000 amphipod crustaceans, 1,500 sponges, 350 ascidians (seasquirts), 3-500 bryozoans (moss animals) over 500 polychaete or bristle worms and 1,000s of platyhelminthes (flatworms) (GBRMPA, 2000). The crown-of\u2013thorms seastar which preys on coral has been an intermittent threat for forty years, drifting on currents from north to south. Outbreaks occurred in 1979, 1994 and, in 2003, between Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands (Reef CRC, n.d.). \n Terrestrial animals are few by comparison. The Proserpine rock wallaby Petrogale persephone (EN) is known only from the Proserpine area and a few offshore islands in the Whitsundays. Koala Phascolarctos cinereus, short-beaked echidna Tachyglossus aculeatus, possums, water rats and fruit bats are known from islands and cays in the area, also 9 species of land snakes, 31 lizards and 7 amphibians. The site includes feeding grounds for one of the world\u2019s largest populations of dugong Dugong dugon (VU). 7 whales and 19 species of dolphin breed in or visit the Park, including blue whale Balaenoptera musculus (EN), sei whale B. borealis (EN), fin whale B. physalus (EN), humpback whale Megaptera novaengliae, sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus (VU), and the dwarf minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata, an unnamed subspecies discovered only in 1985. Dolphins include Australian snubfin Orcaella heinsohni, and Indo-Pacific humpbacked Sousa chinensis, bottle nosed Tursiops truncates and striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba. Spinner dolphins S. longirostris are occasionally seen offshore. There are 28 species of sharks and rays including three species of sawfish, dwarf Pristis clavata (CR), largetooth P.microdon (CR), and knifetooth Anoxypristis cuspidata (CR), whale shark Rhicodon typus (VU), great white shark Carcharodon carcharias (VU), grey nurse shark Carcharias taurus (VU) and brown stingray Dasyatis fluviorum (VU). \n There are nesting beaches of world significance for green turtles Chelonia mydas (EN), and loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta (EN), and habitat for four other species: hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata (CR), leatherback Dermochelys coriacea (CR), Pacific olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (VU) and flatback turtles Natator depressus. The estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus can be found along the whole coast, especially in the north where the very poisonous box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri also occurs inshore. Freshwater crocodiles Crocodylus johnstoni are rarely recorded. Seasonally, between 1.4 and 1.7 million birds gather in the area. Of 215 species, at least 40 are seabirds, 29 of which breed on the Reef. Seabirds include wandering albatross Diomedea exulans (VU), white-bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster, red-tailed tropicbird Phaethon rubricauda, herald petrel Pterodroma heraldica, little tern Sterna albifrons, and roseate tern S. dougallii, the largest roost of which in southeast Asia is on Swain\u2019s Reef. 118 species of butterfly are recorded (30% of Australia\u2019s total) (GBRMPA, 2000). \n CONSERVATION VALUE \n This is the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem, of great scientific value as one of the most complex and biodiverse natural systems on earth. It has more than 2,900 coral reefs built of 359 species of hard coral, over 200,000 hectares of mangroves, with 54% of the world\u2019s mangrove species, over 300,000 hectares of sea grasses, some 4,000 mollusc, 2,000 fish and 6 turtle species; one of the world\u2019s largest dugong populations; breeding grounds for humpback and other whales; and 2,200 species of native plants. The Park lies within WWF Global 200 Marine and Freshwater Eco-region, and a WWF/IUCN Centre of Plant Diversity, It contains two Ramsar wetlands and is an IMO-designated Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). \n CULTURAL HERITAGE \n Aboriginal occupation of the coast probably dates back to the earliest human occupation of Australia c.40,000 years ago and the Great Barrier Reef, particularly the northern sector, is important in both the historic and contemporary culture of the coastal tribes. Little systematic archaeological study has been done but there are large and important sites of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander settlements on several islands. The latter are seafarers related to the Melanesians of southeast Asia. Notable sites occur on Lizard and Hinchinbrook Islands and on Stanley, Cliff and Clack Islands near Cape Melville (14\u00b0S) where there are spectacular galleries of rock paintings. To the clansmen, the coasts of the Heritage Area are part of a living cultural landscape where the natural features are interwoven with their spiritual life, economic uses and social organisation. Their hunting, fishing and gathering within the site remain a legal right since they are recognised as the traditional owners of the Reef (GBRMPA, 2001). About 30 wrecks of historic importance exist in the area. The 1791 wreck of HMS Pandora lies near the northern reef to which it gave its name. The hazards of reef navigation necessitated building many lighthouses, some still historically important. Those on Lady Elliot Island (1866) and North Reef Island (1878) are fine examples of 19th century riveted steel plate construction and are still in operation (Kelleher et al., 1989). \n LOCAL HUMAN POPULATION \n Over 70 coastal clan groups maintain strong cultural relationships with the area and about 11 native-title claims are registered over parts of the property (GBRMPA, 2001). Currently, people living in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities in the Great Barrier Reef area at Palm Island, Inginoo, Bamaga, Sesia, New Mapoon, Umagico, Yarrabah, Wujal Wujal, Hopevale, Cooktown and Lockhart River, as well as in other urban centres, have access to the marine and inshore resources which have been integral to their economy for several thousand years. White Australians live on various islands and a large population lives in the many cities, towns and villages of the adjoining coast. The most important economic activity of the Reef is tourism. \n VISITORS AND VISITOR FACILITIES \n In 1993, it was estimated that 2,291,000 tourists in 542 commercial vessels, visited the Park, spending over 1.8 million visitor nights on the reefs and islands (Driml, 1994). By 2007, approximately I.9 million tourists visited the Marine Park each year, 90% being concentrated in 10% of the Park in the offshore Cairns and Whitsunday areas. In addition, 4.9 million recreational visitors were recorded (GBRMPA, 2007) 40% of tourists arrive with ten major operators (UNESCO, 2006). Tourism is allowed under permit in all zones or 99.8% of the Marine Park. 0.2% is reserved for preservation and scientific research and designated free from tourism and fishing. This very low proportion reflects the large area of open water within the Marine Park. Resort guests make extensive use of reefs and waters for recreation, including fishing, diving and snorkelling, water sports, wildlife watching, sightseeing, reef-walking, shell collecting, sailing, power-boating, overflights and touring. A Reef Educational Program raises reef awareness for visitors to the Reef Headquarters Aquarium in Townsville, as well as throughout the country by school visits &amp; video-link programs. A wide range of interpretive facilities include detailed zoning plans and introductory guides for each section of the Park, a Tourism Operators Handbook, an Interpretive Manual for reef guides, and numerous bulletins &amp; leaflets (GBRMPA, 2001). \n SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND FACILITIES \n The Great Barrier Reef offers unparalleled opportunities for scientific research. Researchers have been active in the area since the formation of the Great Barrier Reef Committee, now the Australian Coral Reef Society, in 1922, and the British Great Barrier Reef Expedition to the Low Isles in 1928-29. Such research has become more critical because of the World Heritage status, the outbreaks of crown-of-thorns seastar and coral bleaching, and intensifying human pressures on the Reef. Research is conducted by scientists from many Australian universities and institutions, concentrating for logistical reasons, on field research stations and North Queensland mainland centres. For local and visiting overseas scientists, field stations are operated by the University of Queensland (Heron Island), the University of Sydney (One Tree Island), and in Townsville, James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the Cooperative Research Centre (Reef CRC) established in 1993 as a joint venture between James Cook University, the Association of Marine Park Tourist Operators, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, scientific bodies and the GBRMPA. \n There are extensive coral reef research programmes covering the full range of scientific disciplines. Research into ecologically sustainable development of the Marine Park is integrated in the Cooperative Research Centre. In 2001, the GBRMPA developed a comprehensive list of high priority research needs to co-ordinate reef research. A list of about 75 websites was attached for hundreds of scientific &amp; technical studies (GBRMPA, 2001). The GBRMPA program is currently grouped into several sub-programs, for water quality, coral bleaching, biodiversity, the effects of fishing, monitoring crown-of-thorns seastars; tourism and environmental sustainability. Research by AIMS on the mangroves of Hinchinbrook I. have made them one of the best studied mangrove systems in the world. Most research is carried out by outside agencies under contracts with the Authority (Kelleher et al., 1989), but much of the monitoring activity is directly coordinated by Authority staff. Other research is listed in Frankel (1978), Baker et al. (1983), GBRMPA (1985), Engelhardt &amp; Lassig (1993), Bellwood (1994), GBRPMA (1994) and Lucas et al. (1997). \n MANAGEMENT \n The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 provided for the establishment, control, care and development of a Marine Park covering 98.5% of the Great Barrier Reef Region as defined in the Act. These powers were transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1976 and Fisheries Act of 1976 respectively. The major pieces of state legislation identified in the nomination were changed by provisions of the Nature Conservation Act 1992 and the Fisheries Act 1995. There was initial resistance to the Park\u2019s establishment and 28 coastal areas initially precluded, were only incorporated later. The Act and the responsibilities of the Authority extend over the whole region, generally up to the low water mark on the Queensland coastline and islands. Exceptions to this are primarily existing or potential harbour facilities or where potential impacts may be minimal. Its regulations and zoning plans have precedence over conflicting provisions of both Commonwealth and Queensland legislation, except for the navigation of ships and aircraft. The Queensland Government has responsibility within the area for those waters which were internal waters at the time of Federation and for all islands above the low water mark within the outer boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef Region, except for the few that are owned by the Commonwealth of Australia. The Queensland Marine Parks Act &amp; Regulations introduced in 1982/1989 provides for zoning and management plans for areas in the region adjacent to or not included in the Marine Park. Fisheries beyond Queensland coastal waters are managed cooperatively, most species being managed by the Queensland government (GBRMPA, pers. comm., 1995). \n The 1975 Act established a Consultative Committee of representatives of government, industry and community bodies. As the islands, reefs and waters of the area up to the low water line are a continuum they are managed by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments in cooperation, with a Ministerial Council of two ministers from each government, the Consultative Committee and by close liaison at officer level. The Park Authority is headed by a Chairperson and two part-time members nominated by the Commonwealth government, one of whom represents the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities living next to the Park, and a part-time member nominated by the Queensland government. Day-to-day management of the World Heritage property is by the Queensland Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (QPWS) in collaboration with agencies such as the Water Police, Coastwatch and the Customs National Marine Unit. Proposals have been developed by coastal Aboriginal groups to incorporate their interests in indigenous co-operative management of the Park and World Heritage property. \n The value of the property is protected by the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999. Other relevant Acts concern sea dumping, fisheries, transport, environmental protection, coastal protection and management and integrated planning. Drilling and mining in the Marine Park are prohibited except for approved research. The 1975 Act introduced controlled multiple-use planning and management of marine areas through zoning and permissible activities. Queensland Marine Park legislation was amended to allow mirror zonings where necessary, to minimise public confusion where the two jurisdictions interfaced. Zoning plans prepared for all four management areas of the Marine Park provided increasing levels of protection for the more restricted zones, and included regulations reaching beyond Park boundaries. Since 1999, the Act can regulate activities deleterious to the Park outside the Marine Park as far as five kilometres inland. Buffer zones were incorporated to protect areas of relatively higher conservation value. In 2004 detailed revised zoning plans and regulations were mapped, published and implemented: 33% of the Marine Park will become marine sanctuaries (700 sq,km; IUCN category Ia) or 'no-take' areas (114,600 sq.km; IUCN category II) (Fernandes, L. et al., 2005). \n A second major management tool available to the GBRMPA acting in conjunction with the Queensland Department of Environment &amp; Heritage, is the power to make statutory management plans for areas, species or ecosystems within the Marine Park. The Authority may grant or refuse permits for a broad spectrum of potential activities including tourist facilities and programs, education and research programs, aircraft operations, discharge of waste, resource collecting, installation and operation of moorings and traditional hunting and fishing. Since the site was inscribed on the World Heritage list, the 1975 Act was amended to provide for increased powers for inspectors and increased penalties; extended search and seizure powers outside the Marine Park; powers to remedy actual damage or prevent possible damage and to allow costs of clean-up operations to be recovered from convicted offenders, and to permit the Authority to assist other institutions and individuals on environmental issues (Anon., 1989). \n Between 1991 and 1994, a 25-Year Strategic Plan was endorsed by sixty stakeholder groups, with a comprehensive table of all the associated plans for the management of the Marine Park. In 1998, the State of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area provided the first comprehensive synthesis of all available information on the property and stated that the ecosystem as a whole was in good health (GBRMPA, 2001), though this preceded the drastic bleaching event of 2002. In late 1999, Australia drew up a set of recommendations and a management framework in five priority areas: 1) the management of land &amp; coastal catchments, 2) the management of fisheries, 3) the management of shipping &amp; ship-sourced pollution, 4) representative marine protected areas, and 5) resources for research &amp; management. In 2001, the Marine Park Authority released its Great Barrier Reef Catchment Water Quality Action Plan recommending end-of-river pollution targets for all 26 catchments adjacent to the Reef for 2011. Following the bleaching event of 2002, measures such as an annual Coral Bleaching Response Plan and a 5-year Climate Change Action Plan to monitor, study and combat coral bleaching have received high priority. \n Plans to counteract some of the other major pressures on the Park have been drawn up for water quality, fisheries and tourism. Water quality measures include end-of-river pollution targets; codes of practice for agricultural industries; and timelines for the upgrading of sewage discharge facilities. The Federal government is working closely with the state government on the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan, which aims to reverse the decline in the quality of water entering the Marine Park by 2013. Fisheries measures include reducing the numbers of trawlers; by-catch reduction devices, satellite tracking with enhanced vessel surveillance, and a program increasing the extent of no-take areas (4.5% of the area in 2001). Tourism measures include statutory plans of management; a register of best environmental practices; and a reef-wide mooring policy. Another major element in managing and protecting the Reef is the education of reef users to appreciate the environment and to exercise care when visiting it. The Authority has an education/ information section which produces programs and materials for public education and assists tourist operators in the development of conservation and education activity programs for visitors (Kelleher, et al., 1989). One of the highest monitoring levels of any World Heritage area is claimed for the Park. This is conducted mainly by the Cooperative Research Centre and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Major monitoring themes are coral bleaching, long-term coral reef health, seagrass watch, chlorophyll production, and coordinated water quality. Large monitoring projects include the impacts of commercial and recreational fishing on the sustainability of fish stocks in the Park. \n MANAGEMENT CONSTRAINTS \n The six main threats to the World Heritage values of the property are: coral bleaching due to climate warming; catchment water quality and run-off from coastal developments; the impacts of increasing fishing levels (bottom prawn trawling, line, net and pot fishing); the impacts of increasing tourism and recreational use; biodiversity loss from oil and other pollutants and predation by red foxes, feral cats and pigs; and cyclic outbreaks of crown of thorns seastars. \n There are conflicts between the various uses of the reef and its maintenance in a pristine condition. Some parts have already reached use levels that exploit the full productive capacity of the system. Anthropogenic eutrophication, mostly from agricultural run-off, can have widespread impacts. Studies in the lagoon near the Low Isles indicated significant increases in phytoplankton concentrations in the last 65 years. Run-off from islands and the mainland contains sediments, herbicides, pesticides, nutrients, and other materials damaging to the reef (Bell &amp; Elmetri, 1995). The hazard of oil spills from the many ports and from shipping routes carrying 6,000 ships a year, 10% of them with oil and chemicals, is greatest in the Whitsunday Islands, near Cairns and between Cape Flattery and Cape York. Pilotage for large vessels is compulsory and dumping of any kind from any vessel, aircraft or platform is illegal. \n Two reports (Hillman, 1996; McPhail, 1996) warned that increasing recreational use had become a problem. Unacceptable ecological impacts from reef-based tourism include the discharge of waste, litter and fuel, physical damage to reefs from anchors, people snorkelling, diving and reef walking, disturbance of fauna, especially seabirds, and over-fishing or collecting. With other factors these have contributed to the decline of turtle and dugong populations. All of these impacts may be managed to some extent by design, prohibition or limitation (Kelleher et al., 1989). However, the Port Hinchinbrook Resort (1,500 beds, 250-berth marina with jet airstrip and seaplane access proposed) was built in the 1990s on the Hinchinbrook Channel within the World Heritage area (but outside the Marine Park) at Oyster Point near Cardwell. It had local, state and federal support and was completed despite strong opposition from environmentalists, taken as far as the Federal court (GBRMPA, 2001). Its impacts are strictly monitored but, in addition, the development set a precedent for similar activities (Haigh, 1997). The development of faster speedboats mean that 81% of the park can now be accessed on a day-trip. Numbers of fish and other marine fauna are declining; there has been an apparent 90% decline in dugong numbers south of Cooktown since the 1960\u2019s and a 70-90% decline in loggerhead turtles since 1970. The various turtle populations are threatened by habitat loss, fishing net kills and hunting (Hillman, 1996; GBRMPA, 2001). \n However, in 1998 and 2002, major bleaching events occurred and since 2002 climate warming has become a severe threat even though most of the reefs escaped extensive mortality. The World Heritage site is vulnerable to any change in sea level rise, sea temperature increase, storm frequency and intensity, precipitation, drought, land run-off, changing oceanic circulation, and ocean acidity. In 2002, according to the World Heritage Committee Climate Change Working Group (2006), between 60 and 95 per cent of the Barrier reefs were affected. Most of these recovered well but about 5% suffered high mortality, losing between 50 and 90% of their corals. In response, a AUD\\$2 million Climate Change Response Programme for 2004 to 2008 was developed to prepare an annual Coral Bleaching Response Plan and a Climate Change Action Plan by 2007. \n Assessments made include a Coral Bleaching Forecast system, ecosystem vulnerability, resilience indicators, defining social resilience and frameworks for social assessments. Outcomes include policy congruence, international recognition, research coordination and investment, stakeholder and NGO partnerships, community partnership teams, programs such as Bleach Watch, part of an early warning system, and production of a Tourism Leaders Forum and a Manager\u2019s Guide to Coral Bleaching. The Coral Bleaching Response Plan to detect and measure bleaching and other impacts using satellite imagery, aerial and underwater surveys, and community observations received worldwide recognition. The Authority\u2019s bleaching management programs are recognised as the world\u2019s best practice. The Great Barrier Reef has had relatively low bleaching to date, but further events will be inevitable. The main challenge is to increase the broad resilience of the Marine Park and in 2004, the GBRMPA increased the percentage of no-take area in the Park from 4.5% to 33% (UNESCO WHC, 2006; WWF, 2006; Rothwell, 2004). \n STAFF \n In 2001, the Authority had 157 staff, operating from its main office in Townsville working with some 94 staff in the Queensland Parks &amp; Wildlife Service in daily management. Field officers are limited in number with only seven being available on any given day to supervise the 800 km between Cooktown and the end of the Cape York Peninsula (Kelleher et al., 1989). In 1995 there were 300 Marine Park inspectors working within a range of federal and state services (GBRMPA, pers. comm., 1995). In 1996 there were also nine staff in Canberra (GBRMPA, pers. comm., 1996). \n BUDGET \n The total gross expenditure by government on the Marine Park for the 2000-2001 financial year was estimated at AUS\\$78 million (US\\$46.8 million), including funds from the government, universities and the private sector. The operating expense for the Park was about AUS\\$30.6 million (US\\$18.4 million). Matching funds were provided under the 1979 Emerald Agreement, by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments for park management (GBRMPA, 2001). In the early 1990s tourism generated an estimated AUD\\$1 billion (US\\$750 million) a year (Driml, 1994; McPhail, 1996). \n LOCAL ADDRESSES \n Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, PO Box 1379, Townsville, QLD 4810. \n GBRMPA, (Canberra Office) GPO Box 791, Canberra, ACT 2601. \n Department of the Environment, Sports &amp; Territories, PO Box 787, Canberra, ACT 2601. \n REFERENCES \n The principal source for the above information was the original nomination for World Heritage status.

The Great Barrier Reef extends in roughly a northwest-southeast direction for more than 1,250 miles (2,000 km), at an offshore distance ranging from 10 to 100 miles (16 to 160 km), and its width ranges from 37 to 155 miles (60 to 250 km). The Great Barrier Reef has an area of some 135,000 square miles (350,000 square km), and it has been [characterized](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characterized), somewhat inaccurately, as the largest structure ever built by living creatures.\n\n## Geography\n\n[![Great Barrier Reef](https://cdn.britannica.com/67/152567-050-C976C2B3/Great-Barrier-Reef.jpg?w=300)](https://cdn.britannica.com/67/152567-050-C976C2B3/Great-Barrier-Reef.jpg)\n\n[Great Barrier Reef](https://cdn.britannica.com/67/152567-050-C976C2B3/Great-Barrier-Reef.jpg)(more)\n\nThe reef actually consists of some 2,100 individual reefs and some 800 fringing reefs (formed around islands or bordering coastlines).

In spite of this variety, the reefs share a common origin: each has been formed, over millions of years, from the skeletons and skeletal waste of a mass of living marine organisms. The \u201cbricks\u201d in the reef framework are formed by the calcareous remains of the tiny creatures known as coral [polyps](https://www.britannica.com/science/polyp-zoology) and hydrocorals, while the \u201ccement\u201d that binds these remains together is formed in large part by [coralline](https://www.britannica.com/science/Corallina) [algae](https://www.britannica.com/science/algae) and [bryozoans](https://www.britannica.com/animal/moss-animal).

Biological and ecological values that support criteria (ix) and (x) have been significantly degraded. Coral communities have undergone repeated bleaching and the ecological processes that sustain these systems, such as recruitment, reef building, and symbiosis, are under severe pressure, with key predator populations such as sharks and rays remaining in long-term decline. Significant and ongoing deterioration is also observed in the condition of threatened species, including hawksbill turtles, dugongs, some seabird colonies, and multiple fish stocks. While mangrove forests remain relatively stable, seagrass condition varies considerably, and deep-water meadows remain poorly understood. The reef\u2019s aesthetic and scenic values central to its listing under criterion (vii) also face decline. Coral mortality, algal overgrowth, and degraded water quality are visibly reducing underwater clarity and reef complexity. However, key geological and geomorphic features remain intact.\nClimate change is the most significant and intensifying threat, with five mass bleaching events since 2016 severely impacting coral cover, ecosystem processes, and dependent species. Key ecological functions\u2014such as recruitment, reef building, and predation\u2014are compromised, and many biological attributes, including coral diversity, threatened species, and fish populations, are declining. Localised recovery in some reefs and seagrass meadows is offset by broader deterioration, particularly in areas vulnerable to heat stress, poor water quality, or fishing pressure. The resilience of the reef to climate change is compounded by poor catchment water quality, unsustainable fisheries practices, coastal development, and cumulative impacts. Sediment and nutrient runoff continue to exceed targets, despite considerable investment, and enforcement challenges persist, especially in fisheries with inadequate independent monitoring.\nManagement of the World Heritage site is supported by a sophisticated legal and institutional framework, underpinned by the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan and its associated investment strategies. Governance is shared across Commonwealth and Queensland jurisdictions, with strong partnerships in place with Traditional Owners and local communities. The Reef 2050 Plan, updated in response to successive Reactive Monitoring Missions, now incorporates enhanced climate adaptation, water quality targets, and biodiversity recovery objectives. However, while the strategic intent is strong, the pace and scale of implementation remain insufficient to reverse declining trends in key values. Despite considerable investment and reforms, challenges in increasing the scale of operations to align with policy commitments, in particular failure to meet water quality targets and the need to increase climate action, continue to undermine the site\u2019s resilience.\nWithout accelerated and sustained action to mitigate climate impacts, improve water quality, and strengthen cross-sectoral implementation, the long-term resilience of the reef and the integrity of its World Heritage values remain in serious jeopardy. The Great Barrier Reef may already be forever changed, but it has various possible futures and the choices made today will lead to vastly different outcomes. Strong and effective actions are urgently required at global, regional and local scales if this iconic World Heritage property is to retain its values for future generations.\nRead moreRead less\n### Current state and trend of VALUES\nCritical\nThe World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef remain under serious pressure, with multiple values assessed as degraded and trending negatively, particularly those reliant on biological integrity and ecological processes. While some attributes such as geological formations, large-scale biological phenomena, and aspects of scenic beauty remain largely intact and continue to support the site\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), they are increasingly vulnerable to escalating and compounding threats, most notably climate change. The reef has experienced repeated mass coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024, along with intensified cyclonic activity and flooding. These extreme events are undermining ecological stability and resilience across broad spatial scales. Fundamental ecological processes such as recruitment, reef building, and predation are increasingly compromised by climate-driven disturbances, with many assessed as poor or deteriorating. The biological diversity of the reef is also in decline amid concerns that coral assemblages may be shifting toward fast-growing, disturbance-tolerant species, which reduce overall functional and taxonomic diversity. However, while this might be true in some areas, there is not yet comprehensive evidence of such community structure changes at larger scales, such as a whole individual reef or the whole Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. Iconic and threatened species, including marine turtles, dugongs, some seabird populations, and sharks, are declining in condition, reproductive success, or range. Coral reef fish communities are being restructured by habitat degradation, fisheries pressure, and impacts from warming waters. These changes suggest declining ecological function and reduced ecosystem resilience. While mangrove condition remains relatively stable, seagrasses in some regions have not recovered from recent disturbance, and deep-water meadow condition remains largely unknown. The reef\u2019s aesthetic and scenic values remain globally significant, but are being diminished by coral bleaching, algal overgrowth, and reduced habitat complexity. Visitor perceptions of the reef\u2019s natural beauty have declined in the aftermath of recent bleaching events, reflecting both real and perceived losses in visual quality. Geological and physical features\u2014such as reef structure, island-cay systems, and sedimentary dynamics\u2014remain robust and continue to demonstrate the values for which the site was inscribed under Criterion (viii). However, their long-term resilience may be affected by accelerating sea level rise and ocean acidification, particularly in relation to reef accretion and carbonate balance.\nRead moreRead less\n### Overall THREATS\nVery High Threat\nThe values of the Great Barrier Reef continue to be seriously affected by a wide range of threats, but primarily those related to climate change, poor water quality, particularly from land-based activities, unsustainable fishing practices and the impacts of coastal developments. Climate change remains the most significant threat to the long-term conservation of the Great Barrier Reef. The most recent mass bleaching event occurred in 2024, the fifth such event in the past eight years, following events in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2022. Each of these bleaching events has seriously affected many elements underpinning the Outstanding Universal Value of the site. Poor water quality due to catchment runoff, impacts from coastal development, impacts from fishing and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks also continue to pose major threats to the long-term conservation of the site. Despite the scale of management and significant resources in place to deal with these challenges, the level of threats to the site\u2019s values remains very high. The cumulative impacts due to the synergistic effects of multiple threats is also of increasing concern.\nRead moreRead less\n### Overall PROTECTION and MANAGEMENT\nMostly Effective\nThe protection and management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site is supported by a comprehensive governance framework that has developed over five decades. This system is anchored in strong Commonwealth and Queensland legislation, most notably the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and is delivered through a suite of strategic and operational tools nested within the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan. Governance is jointly shared between Federal and State authorities and is further strengthened by long-standing partnerships with Traditional Owners, who play a central role in stewardship, co-management, and cultural heritage protection through mechanisms such as Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreements. Broader community and stakeholder engagement is supported through the Local Marine Advisory Committees and the Reef Guardians programme, which continue to facilitate participatory decision-making and promote conservation action at multiple levels. The Assessment of Management Effectiveness report for the Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2024 reflects the effective nature of the of the regulatory system, the implementation capacity of management bodies and their compliance and monitoring programs, particularly in direct use sectors. Investments in research and education, as well as the expansion of field management capacity and collaborative enforcement arrangements, have also enhanced the system\u2019s operational reach. Nonetheless, persistent challenges remain, particularly in addressing threats originating outside the site. The reef continues to fall short of key water quality targets, particularly for sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, despite substantial investment, with land clearing in particular remaining a major challenge to address. In addition, enforcing fisheries regulations remains difficult in some sectors. While electronic monitoring and vessel tracking have expanded, concerns persist over the reliability of self-reporting and the limited use of independent observers in high-risk fisheries. In parallel, climate change remains the most significant and escalating threat to the property\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value. While policy commitments have increased and adaptation efforts are expanding through initiatives such as the Blueprint for Climate Resilience and Adaptation, there is an urgent need to scale up climate action to the level required to avoid further ecological decline.\nRead moreRead less\n## Full assessment\nClick the + and - signs to expand or collapse full accounts of information under each topic.

The varied sea and landscapes within the World Heritage site have been moulded over the past 15,000 years by changing climates, sea levels and the erosive power of wind and water (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997).\n#### Spectacular species assemblages\nCriterion\n(vii)\nThe Great Barrier Reef is home to spectacular and globally important breeding colonies of seabirds and nesting marine turtles, including the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding area. Other assemblages found within the World Heritage site include annual coral spawning, migrating whales and significant spawning aggregations of many fish species (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997).\n#### Superlative natural beauty above and below the water\nCriterion\n(vii)\nThe Great Barrier Reef is of superlative natural beauty both above and below the water, providing some of the most spectacular scenery on Earth. From the air, the vast mosaic patterns of reefs, islands and coral cays produce an unparalleled aerial panorama of seascapes comprised of diverse shapes and sizes (World Heritage Committee, 2012). The spectacular scenery includes magnificent vistas of green vegetated islands and spectacular sandy beaches alongside azure waters, vast mangrove forests and framed by rugged vegetated mountains with lush rainforest gullies. Below water is the worlds\u2019 largest network of living coral reefs with spectacular assemblages of hard and soft corals, and thousands of species of reef fish (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997).\n#### Outstanding on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals\nCriterion\n(ix)\nThe globally significant diversity of reef and island morphologies contained within the World Heritage site reflects ongoing geomorphic, oceanographic and environmental processes. Complex cross-shelf, longshore and vertical connectivity is influenced by dynamic oceanic currents and ongoing ecological processes such as upwellings, larval dispersal and migration. Biologically, the unique diversity of the Great Barrier Reef reflects the maturity of an ecosystem that has evolved over millennia; evidence exists for the evolution of hard corals and other fauna (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997).\n#### Outstanding diversity of plants including mangroves and seagrass\nCriterion\n(x)\nThe continental islands within the World Heritage property support thousands of plant species, while the coral cays have their own distinct flora including threatened species. The shallower marine areas support 37 species of mangroves (54% of the world diversity). There are around 6000 km2 of shallow water coastal seagrass meadows, and modelled values suggest nearly 40,000 km2 of deep-water seagrasses (down to 70 metres) can also be found with a far greater area of potential habitat (Carter et al 2021a, b; World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; 2013a; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997; GBRMPA, 2009; Coles et al., 2009; Coles et al., 2015). There are as many as 15 seagrass species (22% of the world\u2019s species) with one sub-tidal species of seagrass (Halophila tricostata), endemic to the area (GBRMPA, 2019a). More than 880 species of benthic algae exist in the Great Barrier Reef and the total number of species of large, fleshy macroalgae is unquantified (GBRMPA, 2019a). Since 2016, three new species of mangrove have been recorded within the World Heritage site, through either new species identification or range extension (GBRMPA, 2019a).\n#### Outstanding diversity of invertebrate species, including hard and soft corals\nCriteria\n(vii)\n(x)\nThe Great Barrier Reef is home to thousands of species of hard (skeletonised) and soft corals and to 32 invertebrate phyla (major groups), consisting of over 12,000 described species (GBRMPA, 2019a). It also includes at least 300 species of tunicates, 332 species of bryozoans, 630 species of echinoderms, at least 6,000 species of molluscs, at least 2,500 species of sponges and a high diversity of flatworms, crustaceans and polychaetes (GBRMPA, 2019a). Molecular phylogenomic tools are revealing that the taxonomic diversity and biogeography of reef corals is far different from previously thought. This is largely attributable to numerous distinct species being lumped together due to morphological similarity \u2013what were previously thought to be a single species with considerable morphological variation among habitats or across geographic regions are now known to represent distinct species. Importantly, the geographic ranges of many species are much smaller than previously thought. Coral assemblages on the GBR were previously thought to comprise species found across much of the Indo-Pacific; however, emerging evidence indicates that many species occur only on the GBR or the south-west Pacific region (Bridge et al. 2024; Meziere et al. 2024; Rasmussen et al. 2025). Furthermore, molecular data are revealing biogeographic patterns within the GBR region; for example, the southernmost regions of the GBR support many species that occur only in south-eastern Australia (e.g. Lord Howe Island, the Solitary Islands, and Moreton Bay), most of which are undescribed. Similarly, there is emerging evidence that inshore reefs may also support unique species that are highly divergent from counterparts occurring on the mid-shelf and offshore (e.g. Matias et al. 2023). Taxonomic diversity aside, these findings have important implications for understanding extinction risk in reef corals. Clearly, the populations of many coral species are far smaller than previously assumed, suggesting their risk of extinction is higher than previously thought. This is particularly the case for small-ranged endemics, such as those from the southern GBR and subtropical south-eastern Australia. Moreover, the vast majority of these species are currently undescribed, and without further research to resolve their taxonomy and distributions these species are likely to experience silent extinction. These findings have important implications for understanding the population dynamics of corals on the GBR (Sheets et al. 2018).\n#### Outstanding diversity of fish including threatened species\nCriterion\n(x)\nGreat Barrier Reef is home to over 1,600 species of fish in more than 130 families with the number of reef-associated fish alone being 1,468 (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; 2013a; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997; GBRMPA, 2009). Approximately 136 different species of chondrichthyan fishes are known to inhabit the Great Barrier Reef, 82 of which are sharks, making it a global hotspot of shark species richness, functional diversity and endemicity (GBRMPA, 2019a).\n#### Threatened reptiles\nCriterion\n(x)\nWith six of the world\u2019s seven species of marine turtle, the Great Barrier Reef provides globally important nesting and feeding grounds for loggerhead (Caretta caretta, EN); green (Chelonia mydas, EN); hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata, CR) and flatback (Natator depressus, DD) turtles, including one of the last significant breeding populations of the hawksbill turtle in the world, which is in decline and risks complete loss of nesting within the next 10-15 years, the largest green turtle breeding population in the world nesting in the northern GBR and which is also in decline, and 70% of the South Pacific breeding population of the loggerhead turtle which is considered severely depleted. Sixteen species of true sea snakes have been recorded, of which 14 species maintain permanent breeding populations (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997; Heatwole &amp; Lukoschek, 2008; GBRMPA, 2012; GBRMPA, 2019a; GBRMPA 2024).\n#### Bird diversity\nCriteria\n(vii)\n(x)\nThe Great Barrier Reef region supports breeding populations of 21 seabird species.\u00a0Raine Island is the only known breeding site in Australia for the critically endangered herald petrel (Pterodroma heraldica) (GBRMPA, 2024). Approximately 41 (80 per cent) of Australia\u2019s shorebird species are known to inhabit the Great Barrier Reef region and adjacent coastline (GBRMPA, 2024).\nLong-term trend analysis of populations of 9 seabird species from 32 of the GBR\u2019s islands and cays found that trends varied markedly among species and sites from 1979 to 2018 (Woodworth et al, 2021). Most species (including, for example, lesser and greater crested terns) showed increases and decreases at different sites. Overall, population declines were detected in 39 out of 86 assessed species and site combinations (45 per cent), followed by \u2018no change\u2019 in 31 (41 per cent) and increases in 12 combinations (14 per cent).\n#### Threatened marine mammals\nCriterion\n(x)\nThe Great Barrier Reef is home to one of the world\u2019s largest populations of dugong (Dugong dugon, VU). It is also a significant refuge for cetaceans with 15 species of whales and 18 species dolphins, including the Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni, VU) and the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis, VU). The GBR is regionally important habitat for the dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata, LC) and an important breeding ground for humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae, LC). Longman\u2019s beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus, DD), one of the rarest whale in the world, has been recorded here (World Heritage Committee, 2012; State Party of Australia, 1981; IUCN, 1981; Lucas et al., 1997). The first recorded sighting of a rare Omura\u2019s whale (Balaenoptera omurai) in the Great Barrier Reef was filmed in 2016 (GBRMPA, 2019a).\n[Other important values](#bootstrap-panel--2--content)\nOngoing connections between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their sea-country\nThe Retrospective SOUV provides clear recognition of cultural values by virtue of the approved wording that states \u201c\u2026strong ongoing links between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and their sea-country, and includes numerous shell deposits (middens) and fish traps, plus the application of story places and marine totems\u201d.\nThis specific wording in the approved SOUV was approved on the basis that the criteria at the time of inscription clearly referred to &quot;...outstanding examples representing significant ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and man&#039;s interaction with his natural environment&quot;.\nThe attributes relating to this value include:\n(1) Location-specific evidence of historic occupation\n1a) Tangible attributes e.g., rock art sites, artefact scatter, middens, stone quarry, occupation site/rock shelter, burial sites, secret/sacred places/objects\n1b) Intangible attributes e.g., sacred sites (such as initiation sites, Women\u2019s Business, \u2018dangerous\u2019 sites), ceremonial places\n(2) Broad-area examples of historic occupation\n2a) Tangible attributes e.g., recognised resistance/conflict sites, recognised trading areas\n2b) Intangible attributes e.g., Dreaming/creation places, traditional pathways, song-lines\n(3) Contemporary use by Indigenous people\n3a) Tangible attributes e.g., Looking after country (including fire management); species essential to pass on traditional knowledge (such as medicinal plants); Traditional foods/bush-tucker; species used to make traditional items (spears, nulla-nulla, dillies, nets, necklaces, etc)\n3b) Intangible attributes e.g., totemic species (plants &amp; animals); links to ancestors\nThese values and attributes provide a strong basis for the cultural interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to be considered in any legislative deliberations about the GBR, including any permit or EIS approval assessments. (GBRMPA, 1981; World Heritage Committee, 2012; Lucas et al., 1997; GBRMPA, 2014; GBRMPA, 2019; GBRMPA 2024).\n### Assessment information\n[Threats](#bootstrap-panel--6--content)\n[Current Threats](#bootstrap-panel--4--content)\nVery High Threat\nClimate change, poor water quality from land-based activities and runoff, impacts from coastal development, impacts of fishing and shipping-related impacts pose the biggest threats to the long-term conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and its Outstanding Universal Value. Collectively the various impacts of climate change pose the greatest current threat to the GBR, and both local and global efforts are urgently required to reduce those impacts. Poor water quality is an extremely important threat, particularly affecting in-shore regions of the reef. The extent of impacts from consecutive coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2024 in terms of both frequency and severity, has never been seen historically. The 2024 Great Barrier Outlook Report lists 45 risks to the region&#039;s values, many of which can act cumulatively to exacerbate the impacts. Such cumulative effects are not all well understood and have not been adequately addressed to date. Twenty-eight of the risks outlined in the 2024 GBR Outlook Report are shown as &#039;Almost Certain&#039; to occur, and eight of these risks are shown to have catastrophic or major implications for the region&#039;s ecosystem and heritage values.\nWater-borne &amp; other effluent Pollution\n(Poor water quality from catchment run-off)\nVery High Threat\nInside site\n, Widespread(15-50%)\nOutside site\nWater quality remains a significant and ongoing threat to the site, with land-based runoff\u2014particularly sediment, nutrients, and pesticides\u2014continuing to degrade coastal and inshore ecosystems and compounding the impacts of climate change. The 2021\u20132022 Reef Water Quality Report Card underscores this challenge, reporting very poor progress towards the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (0.7%) and sediment (0.8%) reduction targets. In contrast, very good progress was achieved for particulate phosphorus and moderate progress for particulate nitrogen. Notably, the Burdekin catchment saw a 3% reduction in dissolved inorganic nitrogen due to improved sugarcane growing practices, while sediment reductions of 5.3% in the Murray (Wet Tropics) and Endeavour (Cape York) catchments were linked to streambank repair and improved grazing land management\u2014bringing the Murray catchment to its target for the first time. Pesticide risk conditions remained largely unchanged, though improved in the Murray, likely due to drier conditions. Loss of riparian vegetation totalled 47,519 hectares (0.78%) between 2018 and 2021, primarily in the Burdekin, Fitzroy, and Burnett Mary regions. Wetland loss slowed (&lt;0.05%), and freshwater floodplain wetlands were generally in good condition but under moderate pressure. Inshore marine condition remained moderate, with coral in poor condition, seagrass improving to moderate, and water quality declining to moderate. Importantly, grazing land ground cover targets were met for the first time since 2012, helped by above-average rainfall across all regions.\nThe 2022 Scientific Consensus Statement (SCS), released in August 2024 (Waterhouse et al. 2024), brings together the latest scientific evidence to understand how land-based activities are influencing water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and how these influences can be managed to improve water quality outcomes for the GBR. The SCS made eight overarching conclusions. The first five of these are:\n1. Historical and continuing land management and catchment modification impair Great Barrier Reef water quality through extensive vegetation degradation, changed hydrology, increased erosion, and expansion of fertilised land uses, urban centres and coastal developments.\n2. Pollutant loads from the catchment area to the Great Barrier Reef have increased from pre-development loads by 1.4 to 5 times for fine sediments, and 1.5 to 3 times for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (with variations depending on basins).\n3. Poor water quality, particularly elevated levels of fine sediments, nutrients and pesticides, continues to have detrimental impacts on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. The greatest impacts are on freshwater, estuarine, coastal and inshore marine ecosystems.\n4. Human-induced climate change is the primary threat to the Great Barrier Reef and poor water quality can exacerbate climate-related impacts. Good water quality is critical for healthy and resilient ecosystems and supports recovery from disturbances such as mass bleaching and extreme weather events. Meeting water quality improvement targets within the next ten years is imperative.\n5. While several land management practices and remediation actions are proven to be cost-effective in improving water quality, translating these into more substantial pollutant reductions will require significant scaling up of the adoption of these actions, prioritisation of pollutant hotspots, and greater knowledge of the costs and potential co-benefits of practice adoption.\nFurthermore, in February 2025, a severe weather event in north Queensland has carried vast amounts of river discharge affecting approximately 50,000 km\u00b2 of the reef \u2013stretching across inshore, mid-shelf, and outer reefs as well as seagrass meadows and other marine ecosystems. Satellite imagery shows major flooding across nearly every river basin from Cairns to Mackay; plumes from 10 major river basins merged to form extensive and widespread flood plumes, extending more than 700km along the coastline and 100km offshore in some places (James Cook University, 2025). The Burdekin River, one of the largest contributors to flood plumes on the GBR, recorded its biggest peak flood discharge since 2009. Such flood plumes result in prolonged low light and sediment build-up that can smother seagrass and weaken corals, increasing their vulnerability to bleaching and disease. Elevated nutrients are also carried into the marine environment leading to higher levels of macroalgae overgrowth on coral reefs, lower coral coverage, and less new coral growth. Sediments delivered by the plume can remain active for months after the flood event and can cause prolonged reductions in water clarity.\nAssessment of land clearing trends\u2014based on satellite monitoring through the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS)\u2014shows some progress. A report released in December 2022 showed overall broadscale clearing in 2019\u201320 fell by nearly 40 per cent state-wide and 16 per cent in reef catchments from the previous year. A subsequent report released July 2024 shows overall clearing in 2021\u201322 fell another 7 per cent statewide and 13 per cent in reef catchments. This is a total reduction of nearly 23 per cent statewide and 21 per cent in reef catchments in two years. It is important to note that 78 per cent of this overall clearing was re-clearing of areas that had previously been lawfully cleared. Vegetation in riparian areas is important for water quality as it increases streambank stability and helps intercept overland flows, preventing sediment and nutrient generation from erosion. The Reef Water Quality Report Card 2021 - 2022 released in May 2024 showed limited progress towards the target overall with 47,519 hectares (0.78%) cleared during this period. Most of this loss occurred in the Fitzroy, Burnett Mary and Burdekin regions.\nPreliminary mapping of all reef catchments has been delivered through the Queensland Gully and Streambank Mapping Program and enhanced mapping of the high priority catchments is complete. This will inform the prioritisation of future investment primarily through its application in the Reef Report Card water quality catchment models.\nInvasive Non-Native/ Alien Species\n(Crown-of-thorns starfish)\nOther invasive species names\nCrown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris)\nVery High Threat\nInside site\n, Scattered(5-15%)\nOutside site\nOutbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) remain a serious threat affecting reefs across the GBR Region. The causes of COTS outbreaks on the GBR are complex, and the exact combination of factors that lead to primary COTS outbreaks are not fully understood (Caballes et al., 2024; Pratchett et al., 2017). In addition to the influence of nutrient run-off, fishing pressure, coral prey availability, oceanographic circulation patterns and reduced predation (Pratchett et al., 2017; Sweatman, 2008), temperature has been shown to affect reproduction and settlement of COTS (Caballes et al., 2021). COTS therefore remain the subject of ongoing research interest.\nSince 2019, a build-up of COTS at Lizard Island (Chandler et al., 2023) and Cape Grenville (Pratchett et al., 2022) has been identified and is thought to represent the start of a new primary outbreak. Increasing evidence suggests that the Swain Reefs, Cape Grenville and Townsville\u2013Innisfail sectors (Matthews et al 2020; Brodie et al 2017) are particularly susceptible to COTS outbreaks and may play crucial roles in overall outbreak wave dynamics or initiation.\nActive management of COTS outbreaks has become more effective over the past decade due to various improvements, including adopting an integrated pest management approach (Westcott et al., 2021), developing a single shot injection technique, advances in computer-aided modelling and prediction, and increasing vessel capacity.\nIn 2018, funding for the COTs Control Program was increased enabling the program to expand from two to six vessels, meaning control vessels could be deployed in the far north and far south of the GBR for the first time. Since 2019, increased effort has led to the suppression of outbreaks at both individual reef and regional scales, and new evidence demonstrates that the control program is minimising coral loss at target reefs, making the COTS Control Program more strategic and effective than previous control programs on the GBR. The programme has been successful in holding the densities of COTS below set thresholds on 75% of 57 priority reefs between Port Douglas and Townsville (State Party of Australia, 2019). However, COTS outbreaks continue to be most severe in the Southern Region (Swain Reefs) and between Port Douglas and Lizard Island. Isolated and less severe outbreaks are persisting offshore Townsville and the Whitsundays.\nThe COTS Annual Report Dashboards are available online, and provide an overview of the COTS Control Program and delivery outcomes, COTS outbreaks and coral cover status across all reefs actioned by the Program.\nFishing, Harvesting &amp; Controlling Aquatic Species\n(Impacts from fishing on target and non-target species)\nOther targeted species names\nPrawns, scallops, squid, mackerel, threadfin salmon, sea mullet, barramundi, coral trout, cods, emperors, snapper\nHigh Threat\nInside site\n, Widespread(15-50%)\nOutside site\nThe Queensland and Australian Governments have made progress in addressing fisheries-related management actions since the last IUCN Outlook in 2020, particularly in response to the 2022 Reactive Monitoring mission. Substantial management changes have been implemented through the Sustainable Fisheries Strategy 2017-2027 (SFS), as well as additional regulatory changes to protect snapper, pearl perch and Spanish mackerel. The SFS Year 7 progress report identifies that 30 of 33 actions have been delivered by 2023-2024. Significant reforms in 2024 removed gillnet fisheries from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), significantly reducing risk to particular threatened, endangered and protected species.\nQueensland\u2019s fisheries are managed under a sustainability framework, and key fish stock assessments indicate favourable outcomes. About 93% of fish stocks are considered to have no sustainability concerns. In comparison, 7% are depleted or depleting and have rebuilding strategies in place with targeted conservation and fisheries management interventions to aid recovery.\nNotably, there has been significant progress in phasing out large mesh gillnet fishing in the GBRWHA, with the vast majority of associated licences now compulsorily retired. Research has demonstrated that the GBR\u2019s no-take zones significantly enhance fishery sustainability by contributing nearly half the coral trout catch via larval dispersal and spill over of mature fish (Bode et al., 2025), underscoring the value of spatial protection strategies. This commitment therefore marks an important step forward. Smaller mesh nets (Queensland Fisheries Symbol N11 and bait collection nets), which also pose bycatch risks to threatened species, remain permitted throughout the GBR World Heritage area. While these nets present a lower risk profile than large mesh gillnets, and do not have the same potential to interact with bycatch or threatened, endangered, and protected species, their use within the property may require further evaluation using an evidence based approach to ensure that the use of these nets does not damage the OUV. A transitional gillnet fishery (remaining 28 \u2018NX\u2019 licences) will operate under strict conditions, including electronic monitoring, until June 2027.\nFurther progress in implementing the Queensland Government\u2019s Sustainable Fisheries Strategy (SFS) has fallen behind schedule. Key actions, such as rolling out independent monitoring, are significantly delayed (IUCN Consultation, 2025) and conditions have been amended with independent monitoring and validation to commence implementation by 15 December 2025. The Queensland government was granted an extension to its Wildlife Trade Operation, originally due by May 2024, of a validated and quantitative data collection system in the East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery. Stock assessments, which are critical for sustainable fisheries, have also proven difficult to maintain at the planned frequency. As a result, some 2027 SFS targets appear unlikely to be met, especially those concerning rebuilding fish stocks, avoiding overfishing, and maintaining Wildlife Trade Operation accreditations. However, significant progress has been made in the last 12 months with completion of the Onboard Monitoring Field Trial, and establishment a federal funding agreement to support Sustainable Fisheries and Marine Animal Protection.\nAt present, several fish stocks remain overfished or depleted, and remain open to fishing within the GBR despite their status. The Queensland Sustainable Fisheries Strategy stipulates that fisheries should close if stocks fall below 20% of unfished biomass, which must be enforced in order to conserve the site&#039;s OUV.\nFurther concerns relate to the overall responsiveness and implementation of harvest strategies across several GBR fisheries. In some cases, decision rules that would warrant more precautionary action have been triggered, such as in the Reef Line Fishery, but corresponding management responses have not followed (IUCN Consultation, 2025). Similarly, key strategies in the East Coast Inshore Fishery have not been updated following major changes to gillnet fishing, raising questions about alignment between harvest methods and regulatory frameworks.\nDespite increased investment in fisheries management, ensuring compliance remains challenging. While mandatory electronic monitoring has been introduced for NX gillnet vessels, verifying the fate of bycatch, particularly its condition upon release, remains a challenge. Independent data validation in the trawl fishery has also progressed slowly, even as underreporting of interactions with threatened species (e.g., sea snakes) continues (Australian Marine Conservation Society &amp; WWF-Australia, 2025).\nThe establishment of net-free zones (NFZs) in key dugong habitats has provided some added protection for threatened species. However, smaller mesh gillnets remain permissible within these areas, and other biologically significant habitats remain open to large mesh gillnet use until the full transition is completed in 2027. Once fully removed, these nets\u2019 phase-out is expected to improve outcomes for many vulnerable species. Otter trawling is permitted in approximately 34% of the property, although this area is not all viable and economic fishing area. The 2024 GBR Outlook Report highlighted intensive trawl activity in deep areas of the outer southern Reef, where several species remain at high risk from trawling, according to a 2023 Queensland ecological risk assessment.\nMeanwhile, in the Queensland Coral Fishery, 200,052 kg is available in the coral fishery through individual transferable quota across 9 categories. An additional 88,422 kg is available through competitive commercial catch limits. Under quota arrangements 40,687.65 kg was landed in the 2023-2024 financial year (20.34% of the limit), and 21,428 kg was landed under the competitive catch limits (24.23% of the limit). While 2022 reforms introduced species-specific quotas and restrictions on CITES-listed species, concerns remain about the fishery\u2019s ecological effects, including potential localised depletion and risks to endemic species. International scrutiny has increased: the UK banned all coral imports from the fishery in 2021, followed by the EU\u2019s 2022 ban on five coral species. Many harvested species are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced bleaching, and recent studies confirm the high thermal sensitivity of some of the fishery\u2019s most valuable target species.\nRecreational fishing pressure also continues to grow. While it must be noted that not all recreational vessels are fishing, between 2008 and 2024, the number of registered recreational vessels in Queensland increased by almost 40,000 to a total of 261,290 (Qld Dept of Transport and Main Roads, 2025). Enhanced access to GPS and sonar technology has expanded fishing effort\u2014particularly in inshore zones\u2014raising concerns about cumulative impacts on key habitats. However, it should also be noted that permit fees are used to restock 3 million native and threatened fish in over 60 waterways.\nOverall, it is important to note the progress made in reducing the threat of fishing in the site, including the phase-out of large mesh gillnets and reforms under Queensland\u2019s Sustainable Fisheries Strategy. However, key challenges remain, such as delays in independent monitoring, gaps in harvest strategy implementation, and continued fishing of overfished stocks. As highlighted by Baker et al. (2024), fisheries management is only partially effective in delivering outcomes, and while this remains the case, the threat posed by fishing remains high.\nRecreational Activities, Other Human Disturbances\n(Tourism)\nLow Threat\nInside site\n, Widespread(15-50%)\nOutside site\nCompared to other threats, direct impacts from tourism remain low. The marine tourism industry is a key partner in the protection and management of the Great Barrier Reef. Many tourism operators ensure their activities are best practice by following the Responsible Reef Practices for tourism operators. High Standard Tourism Operators voluntarily operate to a higher standard than required by legislation as part of their commitment to ecologically sustainable use. These operators are independently certified as meeting best practice standards for the key areas of protection, presentation and partnership. Nonetheless, some impacts from tourism, and recreational activities in general, occur and include direct impacts through anchor damage, vessel groundings, boat strikes, damage to corals by divers and snorkellers, disturbance of wildlife, emissions from vessel operations, as well as potential indirect impacts, such as the potential for the introduction of invasive species (GBRMPA, 2019a).\nShipping Lanes\n(Shipping)\nLow Threat\nInside site\n, Widespread(15-50%)\nOutside site\nBetween 2019-22, some three thousand ships transited through the region, making approximately 11,000 separate voyages each year (GBRMPA, 2024). These ships include trade vessels (bulk carriers, gas tankers, container carriers, vehicle carriers, general cargo ships) and non-trade vessels (cruise ships, superyachts, tug and tows, naval vessels). The region is home to four active cruise ship berths (Bundaberg, Gladstone, Townsville and Cairns), and many cruise ship anchorages, with an annual demand forecast of up to 150 cruise ships through the Port of Cairns (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), along with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Maritime Safety Queensland, regulate shipping activities in the GBR by administering special measures under international and domestic law. These measures include designated shipping areas, navigation markers, compulsory pilotage, mandatory vessel monitoring and reporting, ship routing and shore-based monitoring. The operation of the GBR and Torres Strait Vessel Traffic Service (Reef VTS) now covers the entire GBR Region, providing 24-hour monitoring and tracking of all shipping traffic within the region. This service can divert ships in the event of a traffic conflict, intervene to prevent a maritime incident, monitor maritime incidents, support investigations of potential breaches of legislation, and support effective response to incidents. Emergency response arrangements include an emergency towing vessel that responds to stricken ships, pollution, and search and rescue operations.\nShipping activities in the GBR are further managed under a comprehensive regulatory framework including the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, which supports integrated planning of transport infrastructure, and the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994, which balances marine safety regulation with maritime industry efficiency. The Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 and associated regulations give effect to MARPOL Annexes I\u2013V in Queensland waters, managing discharges such as oil, noxious liquids, garbage, sewage, and ballast water. For Annex VI (air pollution), federal legislation under the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 applies. Port-specific protocols, including the Queensland Coastal Contingency Action Plan and First Strike Response Deeds, provide detailed oil spill response procedures.\nThreats from shipping include greenhouse gas emissions, ship groundings, vessel strikes on megafauna (especially whales), waste discharge, spread of invasive marine species, oil spills, marine debris, propellor wash causing the resuspension of sediment (especially when operating on low tides), antifoulant paint and noise pollution. Smith et al. (2020) predicts a three- to five-fold increase in risk to humpback whales from ship strikes over the next ten years.\nTo address the risk of vessel strikes, national guidance and strategies have been developed, including the National Strategy for Reducing Vessel Strike on Cetaceans and Other Marine Megafauna. The Reef VTS system, compulsory pilotage areas, and routing measures also contribute to vessel strike mitigation.\nManagement of biosecurity threats from invasive marine species is shared across jurisdictions, with ports designated as First Points of Entry under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth). In Queensland, all individuals and entities have a general biosecurity obligation under the Biosecurity Act 2014. The Queensland Seaports eDNA Surveillance (Q-SEAS) program, jointly implemented by ports and Biosecurity Queensland, provides early warning detection using cutting-edge molecular methods and has received national recognition.\nNoise pollution from shipping is being addressed through initiatives such as underwater noise monitoring (e.g., Port of Townsville Channel Upgrade Project), participation in the Environmental Ship Index and NEPTUNES voluntary reporting programs, and the work of Ports Australia\u2019s Noise Subcommittee. This includes collaboration on the development of National Anthropogenic Underwater Noise Guidelines and international standards for ship noise reduction.\nThe North-East Shipping Management Plan (North-East Shipping Management Group, 2019) provides the framework for the management of risks, and complements the Reef 2050 Plan. Since 2014, five oil spills from ships have been reported, one being a moderate-size oil spill and four minor ones (GBRMPA, 2019a). The latest comprehensive assessment of impacts of ship anchorages was undertaken in 2013, but it is estimated that impacts remained at the same level given that shipping traffic has been maintained at similar levels (GBRMPA, 2019a).\nAdditional management responses include sediment resuspension mitigation through routing, timing of vessel transits, and operational procedures at ports. The use of antifoulant paints is subject to international and national controls under MARPOL and domestic regulation, limiting harmful substances. Furthermore, measures to manage marine debris include strict garbage discharge regulations under MARPOL Annex V, with discharge distances from nearest land defined for the GBR outer boundary.\nResidential Areas, Commercial &amp; Industrial Areas\n(Coastal development and ports)\nHigh Threat\nInside site\n, Scattered(5-15%)\nOutside site\nThe catchments, coastline and islands of the region occupy a wide range of different land uses but grazing and cropping are dominant. Many of the important agricultural industries in the catchment are at historical highs, particularly beef, bananas and cotton, which have all recorded their highest annual production numbers and land use areas since 2010 (GBRMPA, 2024). The area under cropping has declined in the Fitzroy and Mary-Burnett catchments but has increased in other reef catchments and are at or around their historical maximums (GBRMPA, 2024). The catchment includes the Bowen Basin, which is the most commercially valuable coal-bearing region in Queensland. In 2021\u201322, of the 54 operating coal mines in Queensland, 49 were in the reef catchment producing 135.4 million tonnes of metallurgical coal and 68.6 million tonnes of thermal coal. Between 2015\u201316 and 2022\u201323, the number of development licences for coal increased slightly (GBRMPA, 2024). Population growth drives coastal development and population growth is higher in the GBR region than anywhere else in Australia (GBRMPA, 2024). In June 2022, the catchment population was 1.25 million and is expected to rise to 1.53 million by 2046. The growth of coastal communities generates a variety of impacts, including increased recreational fishing and other direct uses of the region, coastal development, and land-based runoff. Coastal infrastructure, such as roads, marinas and boat ramps, housing development and the demand for more urban support services, such as sewage and stormwater treatment and energy infrastructure, will increase with an expanding population (GBRMPA, 2024).\nTwelve ports are located in the GBR region, and all come under the Sustainable Ports Development Act 2015 (Qld). Five of these ports (Gladstone, Hay Point, Mackay, Abbot Point and Townsville) have been designated as priority ports under the Queensland legislation. Four other ports are also significant for specific purposes (i.e. Cairns, Cape Flattery, Lucinda, Mourilyan) along with three smaller community ports. These ports provide vital links between Queensland, the rest of Australia and the world enabling the export of agricultural and mineral commodities (especially coal), the import of goods (such as petroleum, cars and household items that sustain regional communities) as well as supporting commercial tourism (especially cruise ships), defence activities and local communities.\nMany of these ports periodically maintain or improve their maritime port infrastructure, which includes maintenance dredging, and in some cases, capital dredging programs. All dredging and material disposal activities in the region\u2019s ports are managed under both Queensland and Commonwealth legislation. Maintenance dredging requirements depend on the local port characteristics, and the total amount of reported maintenance dredge material removed from the GBRWHA between 2019 and 2023 (approximately 6.2 million cubic metres) was 1.5 times that for the preceding 5 years (GBRMPA, 2024). Since 2019, three key capital dredging campaigns have occurred within the ports of Cairns, Townsville and Gladstone. A total of 4.99 million cubic metres of capital dredge material was removed, with that material being used for port reclamation works.\nExtension of existing ports through reclamation and dredging continue to pose locally significant threats to the OUV of the property. Impacts from such port developments include loss and degradation of critical habitat for marine megafauna; fragmentation of dugong, turtle and dolphin populations through habitat loss and degradation; subsequent resuspension of maintenance dredge spoil from shallow dumping grounds and the impacts of the actual dredging leading to plumes which then have adverse consequences for nearby habitats including fringing reefs.\nThe impacts from port activities therefore range from direct removal of habitat, for example, by capital and maintenance dredging of the seafloor, to reclamation of port waters, through to indirect environmental impacts, such as intermittent noise pollution, spills (cargo and pollutants) and light pollution from port infrastructure. While some of these impacts associated with port operations have been reduced, others persist, for example direct impacts continue to occur from coal dust contamination which escapes as coal is transferred between train and ship (GBRMPA, 2019a; 2024). Impacts of additional coastal development also remain of concern, as has been highlighted in the Reef 2050 Plan and the Scientific Consensus Statement (Waterhouse et al., 2017 and 2024; Schaffelke et al., 2017).\nInvasive Non-Native/ Alien Species, Problematic Native Species, Pathogens\n(Outbreak of disease)\nHigh Threat\nInside site\n, Scattered(5-15%)\nOutside site\nDiseases are known to have affected a number of organisms, including corals, turtles, dolphins, urchins, sponges, molluscs, seagrasses, fishes and crabs. For example, at least 8 different coral diseases have been reported in the region. White spot disease can cause mortality in crustaceans; while there are no known occurrences in the World Heritage property, the disease was found in wild crustaceans in northern Moreton Bay in 2020. The H5N1 bird flu has not yet been found in Australia, despite the virus being found on every other continent (Australian Government, 2025). Its presence in Australia could have catastrophic impacts on many bird populations in the World Heritage property. The Australian government is working collaboratively with the Queensland and other state and territory governments to enhance preparedness and national response capabilities. The prevalence of coral disease and disease outbreaks are frequently linked to environmental stress, including rising sea temperatures, storm events, decreased water quality and nutrient enrichment (GBRMPA, 2024). Predators can also affect coral disease by damaging protective tissues and exposing corals to infections, transmitting diseases between corals, or acting as reservoirs for pathogens (GBRMPA 2024). Increased susceptibility is caused by stress from both acute and chronic influences. Marine turtles suffer from various pathogenic diseases, and there may be links between immunosuppression and exposure to environmental pollution. However, disease has only been attributed as the cause of death in a small number of stranded marine turtles in the past 5 years (GBRMPA, 2024). High disease rates in some commercially caught coral trout in 2016 may have been influenced by heavy bleaching on source reefs. With increasing global warming and poor water quality, disease prevalence may also increase in fish species. Consequences will vary depending on the disease and duration of outbreak but could have major effects at a broad scale (Brodnicke et al. 2019; GBRMPA, 2019a).\nChanges in Physical &amp; Chemical Regimes, Changes in Temperature Regimes, Changes in Precipitation &amp; Hydrological Regime\n(Climate change and severe weather)\nVery High Threat\nInside site\n, Throughout(&gt;50%)\nOutside site\nClimate change poses the biggest threat to the long-term conservation of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and its OUV (GBRMPA, 2019a; 2024). Of most concern are ocean warming, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and acidification. The back-to-back coral bleaching that occurred in 2016 and again in 2017 was unprecedented, impacting the upper two-thirds of the length of the GBR. The 2020 bleaching was severe and the most widespread ever recorded (ARC Centre for Coral Reef Studies, 2020; GBRMPA, 2020). 25% of coral reefs overall were severely impacted \u2013more than 60% of corals were bleached, with 25% of reefs severely impacted (GBRMPA, 2020).This followed the highest monthly sea surface temperatures (in February) ever recorded on the GBR since the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s records began in 1900. The proportion of severely bleached reefs in 2020 was exceeded only by 2016, and 2020 was, at the time, the second-worst mass bleaching event of the five experienced on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998.\nThe 2022 coral bleaching event was the first mass bleaching event on the GBR during the La Nina phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Historically, these produce cooler summer conditions on the GBR, with higher rainfall and higher cloud cover. Severe bleaching (more than 60% of community coral cover bleached) affected 43% of reefs surveyed (AIMS, 2024). Worst affected was the Central region of the GBR, where the most heat stress occurred. The majority of the reefs bleached were exposed to moderate levels of heat stress (NOAA Degree Heating Week 5-8\u00b0C-weeks), which has been linked to bleaching but with lower levels of mortality.\nFrom January to March 2024, a summertime marine heatwave (prolonged above average water temperatures) led to the fifth mass coral bleaching event on the GBR since 2016. The 2024 event, which was part of the fourth global mass bleaching event, had the largest spatial extent of bleaching recorded to date on the GBR, spanning all three regions (Northern, Central and Southern) (Cantin et al. 2025). In January 2025, sea surface temperatures were 1 to 2\u00baC above average, with the highest temperature anomalies recorded in the Northern and Central regions, leading to bleaching-level heat stress accumulations. There was some reprieve in February with the arrival of monsoonal cloud and rain but in mid-March 2025, sea surface temperatures increased in the Far Northern region to 1.1\u00baC above average. In contrast, temperature anomalies remained steady in the Northern region (0.8\u00baC) and the Central region (0.4\u00baC) above average.\nThe GBR has recently been impacted by three tropical cyclones. Cyclone Jasper in December 2023 (Category 5 \u2013but only Category 2 when traversing the GBR) and Cyclone Kirrily in January 2024 (Category 3) impacted the Central GBR. In early March 2025, severe Tropical Cyclone Alfred caused severe wind and wave conditions in the eastern part of the Southern GBR Region. Temperatures dropped in the Southern region in the wake of Cyclone Alfred but were still 0.3\u00baC above the long-term average. North Queensland continued to be inundated by heavy rainfall in February-March 2025, with many local communities already recording their highest ever monthly rainfall totals. In February, major to moderate flooding levels occurred across nearly all river basins between Cairns and Mackay. Satellite imagery showed extensive and significant flood plumes from all affected river systems extending more than 700 km along the coastline, spread across inshore, mid-shelf and outer reefs, seagrass meadows and other marine ecosystems (James Cook University, 2025).\nA recent report by AMCS and WWF (2025) summarised the impacts of such extreme weather events \u2013mass coral bleaching and two tropical cyclones - on the GBR during the summer of 2023-24, utilising recent in-water observations (i.e., to 10 February 2025) from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) website. The AIMS website divides the GBR into 11 sectors for monitoring purposes; some of the monitoring results are \u201ccomplete\u201d and others are \u201cin progress\u201d. The full suite of results are on the website, but the AMCS &amp; WWF report (2025) highlights the following concerns:\n\u2022Princess Charlotte Bay: a relative decline of \\~23% in hard coral cover between 2024 and 2025.\n\u2022Cooktown / Lizard Island: hard coral cover was down from 31.5% in 2024 to 21.0% in 2025; a relative decline of 33% in coral cover. Mortality during the 2024 mass coral bleaching event caused the single largest annual decline in sector-wide hard coral cover since surveys began.\n\u2022Cairns: hard coral cover was down from 34.4% in 2024 to 22.1% in 2025; a relative decline of nearly 36% in coral cover. The combined impacts of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event and Tropical Cyclone Jasper produced the largest annual sector-wide decline hard coral cover since monitoring began.\n\u2022Pompey: Coral bleaching was recorded on the majority of surveyed reefs, although the level of bleaching varied within and among reefs, ranging from 0% to 100%. Surveys are continuing.\n\u2022Capricorn Bunker: hard coral cover was down from 56.2% in 2024 to 33.1% in 2025; a relative decline of 41% in coral cover. The mass coral bleaching event, storm swell impacts, and coral disease have caused the single largest annual decline in hard coral cover for this sector in 39-years.\nAs the principal cause of decline in coral cover on the GBR is temperature driven, the above impacts point to the need for urgent action to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to safeguard the OUV of the world\u2019s largest coral reef ecosystem.\nGarbage &amp; Solid Waste\n(Marine debris)\nLow Threat\nInside site\n, Widespread(15-50%)\nOutside site\nMarine debris, especially plastics, is a cause for concern due to its abundance, durability and persistence in the marine environment, and its consequent environmental, economic, aesthetic and human health impacts. Ocean currents transport marine debris throughout the world\u2019s oceans making the GBR region vulnerable to debris derived from a combination of marine and land-based sources (Kroon et al., 2020). Likely sources include commercial fishing boats, large commercial, military and recreational vessels, sewage and storm water, industrial facilities including aquaculture, tourism boats and coastal tourism activities, recreational visitors and beachgoers, and riverine transport of waste from landfills and other inland sources (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThe quantity and relative contributions of types of marine debris collected along the GBR\u2019s coast and islands vary from north to south. Smaller plastic particles, including microplastics (less than 5 millimetres) are consistently detected in GBR surface waters and can represent up to 50 per cent of marine debris in some areas (GBRMPA, 2024). Remnant plastic pieces (hard and solid) (227,395 items) and plastic lids and tops, pump spray and flow restrictors (100,430 items) remained the most common categories of debris collected from 2019 to 2022 (Tangaroa Blue 2023). In addition to plastics, other items, such as glass, rubber, and foam comprise a substantial proportion of total debris found in Australian waters, both in coastal and offshore areas (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThere is a regulatory framework in place to manage ship-sourced pollution in Queensland. Australia is party to all six annexes of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the main international convention for addressing ship sourced pollution including oil, noxious liquid substances, packaged harmful substances, garbage, sewage, and air pollution. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) give effect to MARPOL in Australia though the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This includes roll back provisions for states and territories to give effect to MARPOL in their coastal waters. Queensland gives effect to Annexes I to V in the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 (TOMPA) and Regulation 2018 (TOMPR).\nFor limited types of garbage permitted to be discharged to sea under Annex V (such as food scraps), as well as a number of other waste types across other Annexes, discharge provisions are generally set as a minimum distance from nearest land. For discharge purposes, MARPOL defines nearest land for North East Australia by coordinates which are generally the outer boundary of the Great Barrier Reef.\nInvasive Non-Native/ Alien Species\n(Invasive marine pests, including Didemnum perlucidum )\nInvasive/problematic species\nDidemnum perlucidum\nPerna viridis\nOther invasive species names\nMagallana bilineata\nLow Threat\nInside site\n, Extent of threat not known\nOutside site\nMore than 250 non-native marine species have been recorded in Australian waters, though this figure is likely an underestimate due to the difficulty of detecting cryptic or morphologically similar species. Introduced terrestrial and freshwater species are also present in the GBR catchment (GBRMPA, 2024; DAFF, 2024).\nIn December 2022, the white colonial sea squirt (Didemnum perlucidum) was detected for the first time on tourism infrastructure within reef habitat in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, specifically at Moore Reef offshore from Cairns. Although the species has been known in major Queensland ports for at least five years (and in other Australian jurisdictions for over a decade) this detection, which was self-reported by a tourism operator, marked its first known occurrence in reef habitat. The Reef Authority established an incident management team to work with tourism operators, Gunggandji Traditional Owners, and other partner agencies to determine the nature and extent of the outbreak, with the results informing a management response. Due to the species\u2019 high reproductive capacity and rapid growth, complete eradication is not considered feasible (GBRMPA, 2024).\nSince 2019, two additional non-native marine species have been detected within the region. The black scar oyster (Magallana bilineata) has been found in several locations including Mission Beach, Mourilyan Harbour, Cairns, Port Douglas, Cooktown, and Elim Beach, representing the first record of this species in Australia. Its invasive potential is still being evaluated. The Asian green mussel (Perna viridis) has also been intercepted in the region, including incursions in Escape River (2019) and Cairns (2021), and on multiple transiting vessels; however, no established wild populations are currently confirmed (DAF, 2024).\nPathways for marine pest introductions include hull biofouling, internal seawater inlets, movement of aquaculture stock and equipment, and larval transport via ballast water. Managing these pathways is widely recognised as the most effective strategy for minimising biological invasions in marine environments, where eradication and control efforts have often proven unsuccessful (Hayes &amp; Sliwa, 2003; Bax et al., 2003; GBRMPA, 2024).\nTo address these risks, GBRMPA collaborates with federal and state biosecurity agencies under the National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions. Key measures include the designation of most Queensland ports as First Points of Entry under the Biosecurity Act 2015, requiring risk-based inspections and compliance with antifouling and ballast water regulations; Implementation of the Queensland Seaports eDNA Surveillance (Q\u2011SEAS) program, a nationally recognised early detection initiative using molecular techniques to monitor for invasive marine species; Alignment with national response planning frameworks, including the Marine Pest Plan 2018\u20132023 and coordination through the Marine Pest Sectoral Committee.\n[Potential Threats](#bootstrap-panel--5--content)\nHigh Threat\nOther potential threats include an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the expansion of major new fossil fuel projects, in particular Woodside Energy\u2019s North West Shelf project. Most of the emissions from fossil fuel projects under assessment will arise from overseas and therefore global efforts are needed to protect the site from further climate change related impacts.\nMining &amp; Quarrying\n(Potential impacts of new and expanded coal mines and gas wells)\nHigh Threat\nOutside site\nSince May 2022, Australia has approved ten new coal mines or mine expansions, which collectively represent an estimated 2,449 million tonnes of lifetime emissions (The Australian Institute, n.d.), with the potetnial for further projects such as the extension of the North West Shelf onshore gas processing facility, approved at the state level in December 2024 (The Conversation, 2025). While these developments are geographically dispersed, their cumulative emissions inevitably contribute to global climate change, posing risks to sensitive ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef.\nBeyond climate implications, the project has also raised cultural and heritage concerns, with potential impacts on the Murujuga Rock Art precinct on the Burrup Peninsula\u2014home to more than one million petroglyphs representing over 50,000 years of Indigenous cultural heritage.\n[Protection and management](#bootstrap-panel--9--content)\n[Assessing Protection and Management](#bootstrap-panel--7--content)\nInvolvement of stakeholders and rightsholders, including indigenous peoples and local communities, in decision-making processes\nMostly Effective\nThere is a strong commitment to the protection of the World Heritage property among the vast majority of stakeholders involved, including Commonwealth, State and local authorities, Traditional Owners, representatives from NGOs, the private sector and the wider community (UNESCO and IUCN, 2012). Over the past decade, GBRMPA has been working with Traditional Owners to develop and implement Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreements (TUMRA\u2019s). These are community-based plans for the management of traditional resources which are accredited in legislation and have proved a successful mechanism moving toward joint management of the Reef. In 2019, GBRMPA released its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Strategy aimed at improving understanding, protection and promotion of Indigenous heritage values of the Reef (GBRMPA, 2019b). GBRMPA is also supported by two Reef Advisory Committees (Indigenous Reef Advisory Committee and Tourism Reef Advisory Committee) and nine voluntary community-based Local Marine Advisory Committees. GBRMPA engages with stakeholders through the Reef Guardians programme which includes Reef Guardian Schools, Councils and Fishers. The Reef 2050 Advisory Committee and Reef 2050 Plan Independent Expert Panel support the implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan. Projects funded under the $704 million Australian Government Reef Trust program focus on strengthening relationships with local people, such as farmers (DCCEEW, 2025).\nLegal framework\nMostly Effective\nThe primary objective of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (Australian Government, 1975) is \u201c\u2026to provide for the long-term protection and conservation of the environment, biodiversity and heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef Region.\u201d The legislation, however, also has secondary objectives, including \u201callowing ecologically sustainable use\u201d \u2013the Act stipulates these must be consistent with the primary objective. Since the first severe bleaching event in 2016, it has become clear that the Act does not necessarily enable GBRMPA to act swiftly in response to a severe human-induced event. As bleaching, severe flooding, and potentially more intense cyclones become more frequent, it is essential that GBRMPA can act proportionately to serious disturbance events, beyond simply monitoring and reporting, by rapidly introducing management measures to alleviate pressure on the World Heritage property.\nIn addition, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 provides a legal framework for World Heritage and other environmental laws. There are many other relevant pieces of Federal and State legislation that provide additional legal protection and apply over differing jurisdictional areas within the GBR, addressing such matters as Native Title, sea dumping, historic shipwrecks, fisheries, etc. (GBRMPA, 2019a). A number of specific regulations have been adopted to address targeted issues. These include a ban on sea-based disposal of capital dredge material in the GBR (although this does not apply to maintenance dredge spoil), and restrictions on new port development to within current port limits (UNESCO, 2017). The statutory Zoning Plan is one of many statutory spatial management layers used within the GBR, alongside plans of management for high-use and conservation areas, site plans, special management areas, and other spatial or temporal provisions (e.g., defence training zones, designated shipping areas, seasonal closures, and Traditional Owner agreements). Today, complementary State and Federal provisions apply across virtually all marine waters in the GBR Region irrespective of jurisdiction.\nUnder the Sustainable Ports Development Act 2015, no new ports can be established within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The Act limits port development to existing port limits and excludes areas within both the Commonwealth and Queensland Great Barrier Reef marine parks. It also prohibits capital dredging for new or expanded port facilities outside designated master planned areas at the priority ports of Gladstone, Townsville, Hay Point/Mackay, and Abbot Point (with limited exceptions for the Port of Cairns), and prevents dredge material from being dumped within the World Heritage Area. Additionally, it requires comprehensive master planning for priority ports, which was finalised in 2024.\nThe legal framework continues to evolve in response to emerging threats, with new regulations adopted to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff and improve fisheries management, such as the 2018 Vegetation Management laws (State Party of Australia, 2019) and the Queensland Sustainable Fisheries Strategy 2017\u20132027 (Queensland Government, 2017). Land clearing, particularly of riparian and high conservation value vegetation, remains a persistent concern. Although recent data show a downward trend in clearing rates, most activity remains legal, and current regulations still allow re-clearing of Category X vegetation, even where it has regained ecological value. To ensure land-based threats to reef water quality are effectively addressed, further tightening of land clearing legislation is warranted, in line with the 2022 Reactive Monitoring mission recommendation to the site.\nGovernance arrangements\nMostly Effective\nGovernance in the GBR has evolved over 50 years as part of adaptive management. The Australian and Queensland governments have been working together for the long-term protection and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef since the inception of the GBR Marine Park in 1975. This cooperative approach was formalised by the Emerald Agreement in 1979 which has since been periodically updated (2009, 2015, 2024). Today the Great Barrier Reef Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) provides a contemporary framework for cooperation between the two governments, recognising challenges such as climate change and catchment water quality not foreseen at the time of the 1979 agreement. The latest agreement, signed by the Prime Minister and Queensland Premier in September 2024, reflects the shared vision for the future outlined in the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan and renews the Australian and Queensland governments\u2019 commitment to protecting the GBR World Heritage Area, including its Outstanding Universal Value.\nThe 2024 IGA commits to holding \u201cregular Commonwealth/Queensland Ministerial meetings to facilitate implementation and achievement of the objectives of this Agreement\u201d. This reiterates the statement in the 2015 IGA, however, GBR Ministerial meetings have not been held for several years. GBR Ministerial meetings are the key forum for Ministers to drive policy reform and ensure accountability and transparency by the Executive.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is the statutory Australian management authority for the GBR Marine Park, and works with the Queensland Government and a range of State and Federal government agencies in cooperative partnerships (GBRMPA, 2011; GBRMPA, 2019a; GBRMPA, 2020b). The application of multiple layers of spatial management adds to an effective integrated approach, considered to be the most appropriate for managing a large and complex MPA.\nDay (2023) discusses nine governance principles highlighting effective and ineffective examples of governance in the GBR. Examples of effective governance in the GBR include the IGA that enables the federal and state governments to co-operate effectively across adjoining marine jurisdictions. However, such co-operative mechanisms can fall over if not effectively implemented.\nIntegration into local, regional and national planning systems (including sea/landscape connectivity)\nSome Concern\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises 99% of the GBR World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). Parts of the GBRWHA that are not within the Marine Park include: the majority of islands within the GBRWHA, which are under State (Queensland) jurisdiction (about half of these are national parks); State waters and internal waters of Queensland (e.g. deep bays, narrow inlets, or channels between large islands and the coast such as Hinchinbrook Channel) - most of these waters are State Marine Parks; and a number of exclusion areas around major ports/urban centres (e.g. Cairns, Townsville Gladstone). These jurisdictional differences result in management and legal complexities, and in many cases, have resulted in challenges related to the management of the coastal freshwater ecosystems, estuaries and ports.\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is the statutory Australian management authority for the Marine Park, and works with the Queensland Government and a range of State and Federal government agencies in cooperative partnerships (GBRMPA, 2011; GBRMPA, 2019a; GBRMPA, 2020b). The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park falls under Australian Government jurisdiction; however, the majority of the islands within the outer boundaries, as well as the adjacent catchments, are within the jurisdiction of the Queensland (State) Government. These differences can lead to issues when adopting an ecosystem-based approach to management (Brodie and Waterhouse, 2012). They also add layers of complexity to integrating the World Heritage property into national and regional planning. The Reef 2050 Plan includes several actions for regional and national planning.\nThe Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve, which covers 989,842 km2 and abuts the entire eastern edge of the GBR World Heritage Area, provides additional protection for the property&#039;s integrity (State Party of Australia, 2013). While the Australian Government\u2019s EPBC Act 1999 provides the framework to protect and manage Australia\u2019s World Heritage sites, State legislation exists to manage locations that fall within the property but not the Marine Park. Integration of research, management and monitoring activities across these different areas, alongside timely public reporting of monitoring and government-funded Reef 2050 Plan investments would significantly improve the coordinated management of the site.\nBoundaries\nMostly Effective\nThe boundaries of the World Heritage property mostly align with those of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which comprises approximately 99% of the property. Areas of the World Heritage Area (WHA) that fall outside the Marine Park include: Queensland islands (about half of which are national parks), internal and State waters (including deep bays and narrow inlets, many designated as State Marine Parks), and small exclusion zones around major ports and urban centres (such as Cairns, Townsville and Gladstone).\nThese differences in jurisdiction create management complexities, particularly in relation to coastal ecosystems, estuaries, and port areas, which are important to the overall integrity of the property. Reclamations at major ports such as Townsville and Gladstone, and at smaller sites such as Cairns and Airlie Beach, have modified the physical coastline and there should be measures to ensure that port development and operations do not negatively impact on the OUV of the property, in particular its integrity.\nDespite these challenges, management is underpinned by a comprehensive multi-level system that includes spatial and temporal plans across jurisdictions. A key mechanism is the multiple-use zoning system within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMPA, 2004), which is mirrored by complementary Queensland legislation across adjoining State land and waters. This harmonisation ensures consistency in the application of zoning provisions across both State and federal marine areas, reducing the practical implications of jurisdictional boundaries. The adjoining Coral Sea Marine Park also contributes additional protection and connectivity for the reef ecosystem.\nOverlapping international designations\nMostly Effective\nThe Shoalwater and Corio Bays Area occurs within the GBRWHA and is also listed under the Ramsar Convention; these two locations support thousands of resident shorebirds and at least 26 species of migratory shorebirds, including large populations of six species in the East Asian\u2013Australasian Flyway (GBRMPA, 2024). The marine waters of the Shoalwater and Corio Bays Area Ramsar site are a combination of both State and Commonwealth territorial waters. Marine areas below the mean low-water mark are part of the Commonwealth Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) and areas between the mean low-water mark and the mean high-water mark are generally part of the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park (Queensland). Port Clinton is excluded from both marine parks. Commonwealth and State Marine Park zoning is complementary to provide for consistent management. Much of the area within and surrounding the Ramsar site is managed for marine conservation with designation as either Marine National Park Zone or Conservation Park Zone. However, those areas within Shoalwater Bay itself under State jurisdiction (between low- and high-water marks and including the mangrove forests) have lower protection as Habitat Protection Zone. Corio Bay is also part of the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park and managed under a General Use Zone, with an adjacent Conservation Park Zone along the coast. In recognition of the Ramsar site\u2019s importance for supporting the largest habitat for dugongs (Dugong dugon) in the Mackay/Capricorn section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a large part of Shoalwater Bay and Port Clinton is designated a Special Management Area for Species Conservation (Dugong Protection) under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulation 1983 (Cwlth) within the GBRMP to protect the species from impacts of fishing. This Dugong Protection Area is subject to the Shoalwater Bay (Dugong) Plan of Management (GBRMPA 1997), which aims to manage activities within Shoalwater Bay that threaten dugongs and their seagrass habitat. The principal State Government management planning regimes that guide day to day management within the marine and estuarine waters and some foreshore areas of the Ramsar site include the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park (declared under the Marine Parks Act 2004), the Corio Bay Declared Fish Habitat Area (FHA-067, declared under the Fisheries Act 1994; refer Figure 1-4), and the Byfield National Park and Shoalwater Bay Regional Park (declared under the Nature Conservation Act 1992) (BMT WBM, 2010).\nBowling Green Bay, another Ramsar-listed site, is adjacent to the GBR Region and similarly supports internationally significant numbers of migratory shorebirds. The site is contiguous with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Bowling Green Bay Fish Habitat Reserve.\nImplementation of World Heritage Committee decisions and recommendations\nSome Concern\nFollowing the 2022 Reactive Monitoring Mission, the Australian Government has made substantial policy commitments aimed at addressing the serious and ongoing threats to the OUV of the site. These include strengthened climate policy commitments, such as the adoption of a net zero emissions target by 2050 and a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, alongside increased investment in water quality, reef resilience, and catchment restoration programs under the updated Reef 2050 Plan.\nThe World Heritage Committee has acknowledged these commitments across its recent sessions. At 45 COM, the Committee welcomed the implementation of many mission recommendations, and at 46 COM, it noted with appreciation the climate change addendum to the Reef 2050 Plan and welcomed the delivery of mapped priority areas for gully repairs, the commencement of a comprehensive programme to repair and restore gullies of the highest priority and the significant increases in compliance activity across sugarcane, banana and cattle farmers.\nHowever, despite these positive policy signals, implementation has faced significant challenges. Progress towards achieving key Reef 2050 targets\u2014particularly those related to water quality\u2014has remained slow. The Committee has consistently expressed concern regarding limited progress in reducing loads of fine sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, with high rates of land clearing continuing to undermine efforts to improve catchment conditions. As noted at both 45 COM and 46 COM, these ongoing shortfalls are inconsistent with the Reef 2050 Plan&#039;s objectives and compromise the resilience of the property.\nWhile Australia\u2019s governance framework enables responsive policy action, the scale and complexity of implementation\u2014across jurisdictions and sectors\u2014has posed ongoing difficulties. Coordination across Commonwealth and State responsibilities remains essential, particularly in addressing legacy impacts, diffuse pollution, and ensuring land-use practices align with OUV protection goals.\nIn summary, the State Party has demonstrated a strong policy response to the Committee\u2019s concerns, and several mission recommendations have been actioned. However, challenges remain in delivering outcomes at the pace and scale required, particularly in relation to water quality, catchment management, and climate resilience. Continued implementation, supported by robust monitoring, enforcement, and cross-sectoral coordination, will be critical to fully meeting the Committee\u2019s recommendations and safeguarding the property\u2019s OUV.\nClimate action\nSerious Concern\nThe Great Barrier Reef Blueprint for Climate Resilience and Adaptation (GBRMPA, 2024) marks an important shift towards adaptive, values-based, and inclusive management. It outlines a holistic approach that includes co-management with Sea Country Traditional Owners, nature-based solutions, and large-scale interventions through the Reef Adaptation and Restoration Program (Hardisty et al., 2022). These efforts align with scientific recommendations (Australian Academy of Science, 2022; Lin et al., 2023) that effective protection and management of the reef require adaptation and resilience-building measures alongside mitigation efforts.\nAustralia\u2019s updated climate policy frameworks at the national and sub-national levels are evolving in a rapidly changing environmental and political context. In its most recent submissions (States Party of Australia, 2024; 2025), Australia has reaffirmed its commitment to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and acknowledged the importance of climate action for the long-term protection of the Great Barrier Reef. However, in paragraph 8 of Decision 46 COM 7B.78, the World Heritage Committee reiterated the importance of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and invited Australia to set further ambitious targets and align its policies accordingly. Given the urgency of securing rapid and effective climate action for the long-term conservation of the reef, this remains a matter of serious concern.\nWhile Queensland has introduced new legislation\u2014including the Clean Economy Jobs Act 2024\u2014targeting a 75% reduction in emissions below 2005 levels by 2035, there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation of these targets. A recent electoral commitment to repeal legislated renewable energy targets has raised questions about the future trajectory of Queensland\u2019s emissions reductions (AMCS &amp; WWF, 2025). These developments underscore the importance of ensuring that climate policy coherence is maintained across all levels of government to achieve shared goals for climate resilience and reef protection.\nSeveral civil society organisations have also developed proposals to support Australia&#039;s ongoing engagement with the World Heritage Committee, including an Emergency Response Plan for extreme weather events and strategies for transitioning to low-carbon export industries (AMCS &amp; WWF, 2025). These complement the Committee\u2019s encouragement to Australia to continue enhancing both its mitigation ambitions and its adaptation readiness, particularly in light of emerging climate-related risks to the Outstanding Universal Value of the property.\nManagement plan and overall management system\nMostly Effective\nThe Australian and Queensland governments have a long-standing partnership in the protection and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef, with cooperative efforts dating back to 1979. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is the principal management body for the federal Marine Park, which encompasses approximately 99% of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). Management is undertaken through a comprehensive, multi-tiered framework that integrates spatial and temporal planning tools across both Commonwealth and State jurisdictions.\nAt the core of this framework is the multiple-use Zoning Plan (GBRMPA, 2004), which is supported by complementary Queensland legislation in adjoining State waters. In addition, a suite of site-specific and regional plans\u2014such as Plans of Management, Special Management Areas, and targeted strategies for biodiversity conservation, tourism, invasive species, and water quality\u2014help operationalize this zoning framework.\nThe overarching strategic document guiding long-term protection of the GBRWHA is the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan. First adopted in 2015 and subsequently updated in 2018 and again in 2021, the Plan sets out a vision to maintain and enhance the site\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) through to 2050. The 2021 update introduced strengthened objectives, clearer outcomes, and new priority actions across key themes such as climate change, water quality, biodiversity, and heritage values. In response to the 2022 Reactive Monitoring Mission, the Plan was further amended in 2023 to integrate additional measures aligned with mission recommendations (UNESCO and IUCN, 2022). These include enhanced climate adaptation commitments, new actions targeting the reduction of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and fine sediment, and strengthened governance arrangements to improve cross-jurisdictional coordination and accountability. While the updated Plan reflects a growing recognition of the need for urgent and targeted action, ongoing feedback has indicated the need for further refinement to ensure actions are concrete, measurable, and effectively operationalised across all relevant sectors and jurisdictions.\nThe management system is further supported by the Joint Field Management Program, delivered collaboratively by GBRMPA and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. This program supports compliance, on-ground stewardship, and the implementation of zoning provisions and site management objectives.\nLegislative underpinning for protection of the Great Barrier Reef is provided primarily by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), which establishes the framework for managing and protecting World Heritage properties in Australia. The Australian Government has announced plans to reform the EPBC Act, including legislating a new federal environment protection agency. The first stage of this reform was completed in 2023 \u2013to establish a Nature Repair Market and expand the protection of Australia\u2019s water resources. Laws to deliver the second stage of the reforms \u2013including the environmental protection agency \u2013were passed by the Australian House of Representatives in July 2024, but were subsequently delayed due to debate in the Australian Senate. Following the national election in May 2025, the Australian Government reaffirmed its commitment to reform the EPBC Act.\nDespite the strength of the overarching management framework, implementation challenges remain. Integration of research, monitoring, and regulatory activities across the complex jurisdictional mosaic of the GBRWHA has not yet been fully achieved. Moreover, progress towards key Reef 2050 Plan targets, particularly those concerning water quality and catchment management, continues to be slower than required to halt the ongoing deterioration of key ecological processes.\nIn summary, the Great Barrier Reef benefits from a well-structured and management system that has responded to the evolving threats faced by the site, supported by an adequate legal framework and high-level political commitments. However, in order to ensure these frameworks are fully effective in practice, ongoing efforts are needed to strengthen coordination, accelerate delivery of key targets, particularly in water quality, and translate strategic plans into tangible, on-ground outcomes that can secure the long-term resilience of the reef.\nLaw enforcement\nSome Concern\nCompliance with Marine Park and other environmental legislation in the World Heritage Area is coordinated through the Field Management compliance program. A number of Australian and Queensland agencies participate in a coordinated compliance program, including the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol, Queensland Water Police along with a federal agency, Maritime Border Command. The compliance program for the World Heritage Area takes a risk-based, intelligence-driven approach that uses a wide range of tools to promote compliance. These tools include communication and education, aircraft, vessel and land-based surveillance, monitoring of commercial and recreational vessels through vessel tracking, targeted compliance operations, audits of activities that require a permit, and prosecutions. The remoteness of some locations within the GBRWHA makes compliance particularly challenging, but the overall aim is to achieve high levels of voluntary compliance while also maintaining a strong enforcement approach to deter and detect illegal activity.\nThe compliance program now has a commercial drone operation capable of conducting effective over-water marine surveillance. The GBRMPA provides support for Traditional Owner groups with rangers through the \u2018Eyes and Ears - Better Witness\u2019 training package. This training helps participants determine and describe their role in compliance while working as rangers or as part of the greater community, and potentially be better witnesses when dealing with compliance issues (GBRMPA, 2019d).\nThe 2023-24 Annual Report for GBRMPA indicates 1,149 dedicated compliance days were completed in the Marine Park over 12 months. This was the highest number of compliance patrols ever delivered, 4% more than the previous year (1,101). There were 1124 possible offences reported, but this was a 29 per cent reduction in the number of detected recreational fishing and commercial fishing offences compared to the previous year (1,124 vs 1,583). The significant decline in recreational fishing offences was the largest contributor to the overall reduction of offences, accounting for 284 fewer offences (a decrease of 45%). Over the past five years, electronic vessel tracking, and the compliance program\u2019s strategies have led to a 64% reduction in commercial fishing offences, with only 52 commercial fishing offences recorded in 2023\u201324 (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThere remain concerns regarding the effectiveness of self-monitoring and reporting mechanisms in some sectors, particularly within commercial fisheries. For instance, since the introduction of mandatory cameras in certain Queensland fisheries, there has been a notable increase in reported interactions with significant and threatened species\u2014including turtles, sawfish, manta rays, saltwater crocodiles, sea snakes, speartooth sharks, a dolphin, and a humpback whale. One incident reportedly involved the capture of 51 narrow sawfish in a single fishing event (WWF &amp; AMCS, 2025). While fishers have consistently reported that all entangled species were released alive and without injury, transparent and accurate verification remains a challenge.\nSustainable finance\nSome Concern\nThe Australian and Queensland governments together have invested AU$5.1 billion (from 2014\u201315 to 2029\u201330) to support the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan. This includes $1.5 billion over the period 2021-22 to the current financial year (2024-25) and $1.4 billion over the next years to 2029-30. $2.17 billion of the funding over this period (i.e. from 2021 to 2029-30) is funding committed by the Australian Government explicitly for the reef. It includes $443.3 million for a partnership grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation (the foundation), and $5.2 million to a government department to cover its costs of oversighting the grant to the foundation.\nThe overall level of funding is significant, especially when compared with many other World Heritage areas. However, the relative amounts and priorities must be questioned, given that many of the reef\u2019s values are continuing to decline. It is essential that funding is invested in the actions that would be most impactful for reducing the myriad of threats. For example, considerable funding has been spent on addressing water quality, and while this has achieved some positive results, key water quality targets have been missed and the 2025 water quality targets will not be met even with the funding provided so far.\nGoing forward, the Australian Government\u2019s $AU1.2 billion Reef Protection and Restoration commitment through to 2029-30 includes funding to accelerate actions to meeting water quality targets. Of the $1.2 billion, $524 million is allocated to improving water quality with the greatest sediment and nutrient reduction achievements to come from the $200 million Landscape Repair program and $192 million Clearer Water for a Healthy Reef program which both target hot spot pollution areas in priority catchments. These investments support improved urban, regional and remote land management through voluntary practice change programs, rehabilitating wetlands, and building regional capacity.\nThe Queensland Government has committed $AU289.6 million over five years to 2025\u20132026 to continue the Queensland RWQ Program, however, another 5-year tranche of water quality funding will soon be needed. The Program funds a range of water quality improvement projects working with industry, agricultural producers, communities and Traditional Owners, including an expanded compliance presence to support the implementation of the Reef Protection.\nStaff capacity, training and development\nMostly Effective\nBased on the most recently available published assessments, staffing levels for the management of the Great Barrier Reef appear to have remained generally stable. Previous reporting indicated a stabilisation of core funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), along with a significant increase in funding to the Field Management Program after a prolonged period of stagnation (Leverington et al., 2019). These improvements supported the delivery of key functions such as compliance, maintenance of infrastructure, and threatened species management. However, no more recent information is publicly available to confirm whether these trends have continued or evolved.\nFoundational training for staff has been well established, with some personnel participating in workshops, conferences, and inter-agency steering committee processes. However, field-based staff have historically had limited access to on-the-job training specifically focused on biodiversity conservation. Programs such as cumulative impact assessment and the Reef Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program have offered important opportunities to enhance institutional capacity, though it is unclear how widely these have been integrated in recent years.\nInvestment in staff development had not kept pace with increasing use and complexity of management demands as of the last available reviews. For example, the Independent Review of Governance (Craik, 2017) recommended aligning middle-management classification levels with responsibility areas to support effective delivery. In the absence of updated information, it is not possible to assess whether these recommendations have since been implemented or if new capacity gaps have emerged.\nEducation and interpretation programmes\nHighly Effective\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority undertakes several programs to inform and motivate members of the community about the Great Barrier Reef and its protection and management, including ways they can contribute to its sustainability. Communication and engagement strategies are developed, implemented and evaluated through a range of programs and topics. Each identifies key audiences, tools and channels to communicate and promote engagement in a strategic and coordinated way. The Marine Park Authority\u2019s external website is the central hub of information about GBR health and management, with more than 500,000 visits recorded on the site each year. Social media channels \u2014such as Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn \u2014are also used to communicate and engage with an online community in excess of 60,000 users about the GBR and its management. A targeted education and compliance strategy has been implemented to help give effect to the zoning plan, with focus on high-risk threats. A network of Community Access Points distributes zoning maps and educational material to raise awareness and encourage visitors to follow the zoning rules. Engagement occurs through regional networks, Local Marine Advisory Committees, the highly successful Reef Guardian Stewardship programme, and through information services provided to stakeholders and the community. In 2023, the Reef Guardians Schools programme celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the Reef Guardian Councils programme has been in place since 2007. In 2021 the Australian Government\u2019s national education centre for the Great Barrier Reef closed for refurbishment (now known locally as the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium). The scope of the redevelopment work has changed due to complexities with the facility\u2019s structural integrity. The Aquarium is now scheduled to reopen in 2029. While the extended closure has caused some concern within the local community, the Reef Authority remains strongly connected to the community through its Reef education programs (locally, nationally, and international). The redeveloped Aquarium aims to deliver on its founding vision to provide people of all ages and abilities with the opportunity to experience the beauty and wonder of the reef and learn more about how it is being protected.\nTourism and visitation management\nHighly Effective\nVisitation remains concentrated in a relatively small portion of the Marine Park, particularly around high-use areas such as Cairns, Port Douglas, and the Whitsundays. These areas are managed under site-specific Plans of Management, supported by the Reef Authority\u2019s broader planning, policy, and permit systems. A range of tools is applied to minimise localised tourism impacts, including compliance measures, site stewardship programs, and adaptive management approaches that focus activity around designated pontoons, islands, and beaches.\nSince 2022, conservation-focused tourism has been further strengthened under the Tourism Reef Protection Initiative, which contracted 26 tourism operators to deliver conservation, monitoring, and protection services across ecologically significant sites. Activities included participation in Eye on the Reef monitoring, Reef Health and Impact Surveys, crown-of-thorns starfish and Drupella snail control, and deployment of machine learning-enhanced tools via AIMS ReefCloud. In May 2024, an additional AUD$5 million was allocated to extend the program through mid-2025.\nHigh Standard Tourism Operators continue to play an important role in presenting and protecting the Reef. These operators are certified under Ecotourism Australia\u2019s ECO Certification Program at the Ecotourism or Advanced Ecotourism levels.\nThese efforts are aligned with the broader Blueprint for Climate Resilience and Adaptation (Blueprint 2030), which encourages a shift toward integrated resilience-based management, including through engagement with tourism operators and Traditional Owners.\nSustainable use\nSome Concern\nThe zoning network, Plans of Management, site plans, regulatory limits and permits collectively support the sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Permits are issued for a range of activities including tourism, research, harvest fisheries, dredging, and infrastructure development (e.g. jetties and marinas), and are subject to detailed, risk-based environmental impact assessments.\nFisheries within the Great Barrier Reef Region are primarily managed by the Queensland Government through Fisheries Queensland under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, with the exception of tuna and tuna-like species, which are managed by the Commonwealth. The Queensland Sustainable Fisheries Strategy 2017\u20132027 aims to ensure the sustainability and responsible management of fisheries resources. It establishes specific targets for 2020 and 2027 and sets out 33 actions across ten areas to guide implementation (Queensland Government, 2017).\nProgress has been made on several fronts, including the development of harvest strategies and new monitoring approaches. However, concerns remain regarding the sustainability of certain fisheries. Independent assessments have indicated that a number of fish stocks continue to be depleted or overfished, and questions have been raised regarding the adequacy of current self-reporting practices and the effectiveness of bycatch mitigation in some fisheries. The sustainability of the coral harvest fishery has also been highlighted as an area requiring further attention (IUCN Consultation, 2025b). Assessments are currently underway to determine whether the catch limits are appropriate for select speciality corals. There will also be an updated ecological risk assessment and harvest strategy in 2026 to inform the management of the Queensland Coral Fishery.\nThe establishment of Net-Free Zones (NFZs) is a positive step for protecting key habitats for species such as dugongs, it is important to note that in some areas smaller mesh gill nets (N11 symbol) remain permitted. This may reduce the effectiveness of NFZs in mitigating risks to certain threatened species and underscores the importance of ongoing review and refinement of regulatory arrangements.\nTraditional use of marine resources within the property is recognised as a vital part of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 cultural practices. These may include customary harvest for personal, domestic or communal needs, as well as a broader range of activities through Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreements (TUMRAs). These agreements support sustainable management while promoting sea country leadership, cultural heritage protection, compliance, research, monitoring, and intergenerational knowledge exchange.\nMonitoring\nMostly Effective\nThe Great Barrier Reef is monitored through an extensive suite of programs targeting ecological health, water quality, fisheries, and social and economic indicators. The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) Long-term Monitoring Program (LTMP), operational since 1985, continues to play a central role in tracking coral health and assessing zoning effectiveness\u2014for instance, by comparing the abundance of target fish species in protected versus fished zones. This program complements the Marine Monitoring Program (established in 2005), which focuses on inshore coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and water quality, particularly in relation to land-based runoff.\nCatchment monitoring is conducted through the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program, which integrates data across paddock, catchment, and marine scales to support the Reef Water Quality Report Card. Investment prioritisation has also benefited from updated spatial information with the Queensland Gully and Streambank Mapping Program delivering comprehensive mapping across all reef catchments, with enhanced detail for priority catchments now used to inform water quality models in the annual Reef Report Card.\nAerial surveys of coral bleaching are undertaken collaboratively by AIMS and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) to assess spatial extent, with subsequent in-water surveys capturing colony-level responses. The most recent bleaching events in 2022 and 2024\u2014both associated with marine heatwaves\u2014were monitored using this combined approach.\nMonitoring of species of conservation interest is also ongoing. Dugong population monitoring is led by James Cook University through periodic aerial surveys. Recreational and commercial fisheries data are collected through performance management frameworks and licensing systems.\nFisheries monitoring is conducted by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and includes a range of mechanisms such as stock assessments, biological monitoring, logbooks, quotas, and vessel monitoring systems. Programs are in place for both commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as for species of conservation interest such as dugongs and turtles. However, concerns remain regarding the accuracy and completeness of self-reported data, particularly in high-risk fisheries. While some Queensland fisheries now require the use of electronic vessel monitoring systems and onboard cameras, these technologies are not universally implemented or fully capable of verifying outcomes such as post-release survival or sublethal impacts. As noted in recent assessments, the absence of independent human observers limits the ability to robustly assess the condition of bycatch species, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring protocols to improve transparency and inform sustainable fisheries management.\nPort authorities continue to operate a wide range of environmental monitoring programs. However, gaps remain in the consistency, quality, and accessibility of monitoring data across ports. While a review noted improvements since 2014 (Leverington et al., 2019), further harmonisation is still needed to ensure transparency and integration with regional environmental objectives.\nThe Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program (RIMREP) was developed to align and strengthen monitoring efforts across sectors and indicators. Since 2019, implementation has progressed primarily through the Integrated Monitoring and Reporting (IMR) program, a $40 million investment delivered under the Reef Trust Partnership and managed by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The IMR program delivered 26 monitoring projects across 12 partner organisations, covering biophysical, social, and integrative domains\u2014including development of a centralised Data Management System.\nWhile these outputs represent significant progress, the full integration of IMR projects within the broader RIMREP framework has not yet been documented. Earlier assessments noted the importance of finalising RIMREP\u2019s design and establishing clear governance, funding, and data-sharing mechanisms to support long-term delivery at the scale required (Leverington et al., 2019).\nResearch\nHighly Effective\nThere is a strong research and science base, the result of a large and long-term investment of efforts, and the involvement of many scientists and institutions (UNESCO and IUCN, 2012). The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report process and the Great Barrier Reef Region and coastal zone strategic assessments have accumulated and consolidated knowledge relevant to the management of the GBR and made this available to managers, stakeholders and the general public. In addition, these processes have identified key knowledge gaps and have stimulated programmes and projects to fill these knowledge gaps (Hockings et al., 2014). The science of responding to impacts from stressors such as climate change is only in its infancy (Leverington et al., 2019). Similarly, Leverington et al. (2019) consider that a major research effort is needed around reef restoration and methods of enhancing the resilience of ecosystems within the Great Barrier Reef to ensure that such efforts are based upon solid evidence of effectiveness. As part of Reef Trust Partnership investment phase (2017/18-2023/24) $120M was allocated to the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) with a further \\~$82M recently committed to ongoing research and pilot deployment. Management agencies have developed strong and extensive partnerships with research providers such as CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and many universities. The National Environmental Science Programme (NESP) is involved in reef water quality research, with investment by the Australian Government of more than AU $31 million for this research area (State Party of Australia, 2022). The Australian Institute of Marine Science is also working with Traditional Owners to develop research and monitoring partnerships and combine science with Indigenous knowledge (State Party of Australia, 2020).\nEffectiveness of management system and governance in addressing threats outside the site\nSome Concern\nUnder the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), any action likely to significantly impact the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef, regardless of whether the threat originates inside or outside the property, may not proceed without assessment and approval. This provides an important legal mechanism for considering the potential effects of external threats to the site. While the Act facilitates many aspects of environmental protection, it currently does not include a specific trigger for assessing the climate change impacts of proposed actions. This has contributed to ongoing public discussion regarding how consistently emerging threats, particularly from climate change, are addressed through national environmental legislation.\nThe governance framework incorporates statutory instruments that are generally contemporary and fit for purpose. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan has been widely recognised as highly effective in managing pressures such as extractive use and tourism within the property. However, it was not designed to address key threats that originate outside the boundaries of the Marine Park, particularly degraded water quality from agricultural runoff and climate change.\nThe 2024 Independent Assessment of Management Effectiveness report (Baker et al. 2024) concludes that management is considered weakest for climate change and coastal development, both external factors influencing the region. Nevertheless, climate change has also seen the most improvement in management effectiveness since 2019, including enhanced management of climate change risks and advances in climate change policy at national, state and local levels. Notable policy advances include the introduction of the Climate Change Act 2022 (Cth) and the inclusion of a specific work area under the Reef 2050 Plan that articulates clear goals and strategic actions towards achieving emission reduction targets. Despite this progress in policy, the management of the reef regarding climate change remains subject to significant challenges. Land-based runoff is another external factor which, while largely well managed, has seen declines across planning, inputs, processes and outputs, and the achievement of outcomes remains partially effective. Achievement of outcomes has declined across six management topics. This highlights weaknesses in relation to protection of reef values and reduction of threats to these values, and this may indicate a level of \u2018drift\u2019 in the governance system. For instance, issues are related to: centralised and siloed decision-making in some areas; long time frames from policy changes to delivery and implementation; and, declining system flexibility and alignment with ancillary organisations and policies, including international policy, especially in relation to climate change.\nFor land-based pollution, Queensland and Australian government agencies have made substantial progress in watershed-level planning through the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan and associated Paddock to Reef Program. These initiatives have enabled targeted investment and prioritisation based on spatial models of pollutant load reductions. The 2025 State Party report confirms that updated gully and streambank mapping has enhanced the resolution of catchment planning, and recent monitoring shows improvements in some water quality indicators at the catchment scale. However, the overall rate of progress towards key dissolved inorganic nitrogen and sediment targets remains limited, showing the need for sustained implementation, enforcement, and long-term investment.\nClimate change remains the most significant and pressing threat to the Outstanding Universal Value of the Great Barrier Reef. Recognising this, the Australian and Queensland governments have developed a suite of initiatives to strengthen resilience and support adaptation. These include the Blueprint for Climate Resilience and Adaptation, the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program, and the recently endorsed Climate Change Addendum to the Reef 2050 Plan, which outlines pathways for improving resilience and managing climate-related risks to the reef\u2019s ecosystems and heritage values. While these initiatives reflect a growing focus on climate preparedness, the scale and urgency of the threat underscore the critical importance of continued and enhanced action\u2014both to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adaptively manage for the impacts already being experienced.\nEffectiveness of management system and governance in addressing threats inside the site\nSome Concern\nManagement of threats occurring within the boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area is supported by an extensive and well-established system of statutory instruments, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan, Plans of Management, permitting processes, and joint compliance programs. These tools have enabled effective regulation of activities such as tourism, fishing, shipping, and recreation within the Marine Park.\nThe 2024 Independent Management Effectiveness Report confirms that management of direct uses within the region is functioning at an adequate level. According to the assessment matrix, all categories of direct use, including commercial marine tourism, fishing, shipping, recreation, Indigenous use, research, defence, island use, and ports, were assessed as either \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cmostly effective\u201d for all elements (context, planning, inputs, processes, outputs, outcomes), with the exception that Fishing is only \u2018Partially Effective\u2019 for \u2018outcomes\u2019. These positive outcomes reflect the strength of the reef\u2019s legal and policy framework and operational systems.\nHowever, while management systems are largely effective in managing direct use, the assessment also found that outcomes for biodiversity and heritage values are only partially effective. This suggests that while threats are being addressed at the activity level, broader ecological and cultural integrity is still being affected, particularly in the face of cumulative pressures.\n[Overall assessment of protection and management](#bootstrap-panel--8--content)\nThe protection and management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site is supported by a comprehensive governance framework that has developed over five decades. This system is anchored in strong Commonwealth and Queensland legislation, most notably the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and is delivered through a suite of strategic and operational tools nested within the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan. Governance is jointly shared between Federal and State authorities and is further strengthened by long-standing partnerships with Traditional Owners, who play a central role in stewardship, co-management, and cultural heritage protection through mechanisms such as Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreements. Broader community and stakeholder engagement is supported through the Local Marine Advisory Committees and the Reef Guardians programme, which continue to facilitate participatory decision-making and promote conservation action at multiple levels. The Assessment of Management Effectiveness report for the Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2024 reflects the effective nature of the of the regulatory system, the implementation capacity of management bodies and their compliance and monitoring programs, particularly in direct use sectors. Investments in research and education, as well as the expansion of field management capacity and collaborative enforcement arrangements, have also enhanced the system\u2019s operational reach. Nonetheless, persistent challenges remain, particularly in addressing threats originating outside the site. The reef continues to fall short of key water quality targets, particularly for sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen, despite substantial investment, with land clearing in particular remaining a major challenge to address. In addition, enforcing fisheries regulations remains difficult in some sectors. While electronic monitoring and vessel tracking have expanded, concerns persist over the reliability of self-reporting and the limited use of independent observers in high-risk fisheries. In parallel, climate change remains the most significant and escalating threat to the property\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value. While policy commitments have increased and adaptation efforts are expanding through initiatives such as the Blueprint for Climate Resilience and Adaptation, there is an urgent need to scale up climate action to the level required to avoid further ecological decline.\nGood practice examples\nThere are many examples of best practice management in the GBRWHA. The complementary Zoning Plans (GBRMPA, 2004; Queensland Government, 2004) have been widely cited as an important management and protection tool. The sound governance/legislative framework, with complementary legislation and integrated management for all State and Federal waters is a model approach. Applied research, ecotourism certification, communication, and community outreach programmes (Reef Guardians, etc.) are also best practice. There is widespread public support and consensus that the GBR is important, with many industries recognising that their future depends upon a healthy GBR.\n[State and trend of values](#bootstrap-panel--12--content)\n[Assessing the current state and trend of values](#bootstrap-panel--10--content)\n#### Exceptional geological formations and processes linking reefs, coral cays and continental islands.\nHigh Concern\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe Great Barrier Reef (GBR) represents the world\u2019s largest and most complex coral reef ecosystem, shaped by geological and geomorphological processes such as reef accretion, bioerosion, sediment transport, and sea-level fluctuations over millennia. These processes link over 3,000 reefs, 300 coral cays, and 600 continental islands (GBRMPA, 2024). Despite physical disturbances from cyclones and anchor damage, these geological features remain intact. Current mapping and geophysical studies confirm that the site continues to demonstrate all stages of reef development.\nA wide variety of physical and chemical processes affect the health and resilience of marine ecosystems, and particularly coral reefs and their associated features (see below). These processes include ocean warming, increasing marine heatwaves, freshwater inflow, sediment exposure, cyclones, and ocean acidification.\nIn the GBR Region, sea surface temperatures have warmed by 0.08 degrees Celsius on average per decade from 1950 to 2021 (CSIRO &amp; BOM, 2022). Record high sea surface temperatures were recorded in February 2020 (BOM, 2020). Sea temperatures over the 2021\u201322 summer were above the long term average despite the occurrence of La Ni\u00f1a, a climatic phase usually associated with more cloud cover and cooler ocean temperatures. Rising temperatures and marine heatwaves are associated with mass coral bleaching events in the region (most recently in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2024). Sediment exposure has both positive and negative effects on marine ecosystems. For example, excessive sediment exposure can result in the degradation of coral reefs and soft-bottom habitats (GBRMPA, 2024). Furthermore, over the last 140 years, the average pH of surface waters around Australia is estimated to have declined by about 0.12 units, which is equivalent to a 30 per cent increase in acidity (CSIRO &amp; BOM, 2022). Coral reefs and coralline algae are considered particularly vulnerable to acidification.\nCyclones can disturb coastal and marine ecosystems through high winds, waves, storm surge and heavy rain, so they are important drivers of ecosystem change in the GBR Region. The extent to which cyclone-related impacts damage coral reefs depends on a combination of the cyclone\u2019s intensity, size and the length of time spent on or near coral reefs (Dixon et al 2022). Although a trend of increasing intensity (but decreasing frequency) appears to be emerging, future trends for the other determinants of damage to reefs (cyclone size and speed of travel) remain uncertain (GBRMPA, 2024).\n#### Spectacular species assemblages\nCritical\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe GBR supports large-scale natural phenomena, including synchronous mass coral spawning across thousands of reefs each spring, turtle nesting aggregations on key beaches like Raine Island and Heron Island, and spawning aggregations of reef fish such as groupers and emperors (GBRMPA, 2024). These ecological events underpin the reef&#039;s spectacular species assemblages and its Outstanding Universal Value.\nHowever, escalating and cumulative pressures are impacting the health of these assemblages. Marine heatwaves, especially severe in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024, have led to widespread coral bleaching, reducing habitat complexity and coral cover in affected areas (GBRMPA, 2024). These events have cascading impacts on associated species, particularly those dependent on coral habitats.\nMarine turtle populations face severe stress. The hawksbill turtle nesting population is in rapid decline and is projected to collapse within 10\u201315 years without targeted intervention, primarily due to egg poaching, predation, and changing environmental conditions (GBRMPA, 2024). Northern green turtle populations, while numerically large, exhibit severe feminisation of hatchlings (up to 99% female) due to elevated incubation temperatures linked to climate change, alongside declining hatchling success.\nSeabird colonies are similarly impacted. An assessment of 86 species-site combinations across 32 islands revealed that 45% showed long-term population declines, with just 14% showing increases (Woodworth et al., 2021; GBRMPA, 2024). Key drivers include food web disruption due to ocean warming, invasive species, marine debris, and human disturbance. Migratory shorebirds remain in poor condition, with habitat loss across flyways compounding local pressures.\nCumulative stressors and increasing frequency of disturbance appear to be increasingly favouring fast-growing and opportunistic coral species at the expense of the often slower-growing species capable of competitive dominance in mature ecological communities. This process results in simplified ecosystems with reduced biodiversity and low ecological resilience (Harvey et al. 2021; Staude et al. 2023). Furthermore, species which produce calcium carbonate skeletons and shells (such as corals, molluscs, crustaceans and coralline algae) are considered particularly vulnerable to acidification. In the GBR, calcification declined by 14 percent between 1990 and 2005, mainly due to increasing sea surface temperatures (De&#039;ath et al., 2009). As carbonate concentrations decrease, calcification becomes more challenging and the tendency for calcium carbonate crystals to dissolve increases, leading to overall decreases in calcification on coral reef ecosystems.\nDespite these declines, certain large-scale phenomena persist. Annual coral spawning continues throughout the reef, though larval success and recruitment are reduced in many areas. Humpback whale migrations remain a stable and spectacular event, and dugong aggregations are still observed in northern regions. However, the resilience of these systems is decreasing, with reduced recovery capacity, increasing skew in ecological interactions, and greater exposure to compounding impacts (GBRMPA, 2024).\n#### Superlative natural beauty above and below the water\nHigh Concern\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe GBR remains one of the world\u2019s most iconic natural landscapes, offering visually stunning aerial, terrestrial, and underwater panoramas. Aerial views continue to reveal an extensive mosaic of reef systems, coral cays, vegetated islands, and turquoise lagoons. However, despite the persistence of these attributes at a large scale, several stressors are diminishing the natural beauty of the reef, particularly below water.\nRepeated mass coral bleaching events, recorded in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024, have caused widespread declines in hard coral cover and shifts in community composition (GBRMPA, 2024). These impacts alter the structural complexity, colour, and clarity of reef vistas, with an observable decline in aesthetic appeal. Recovery in some areas has been dominated by fast-growing, opportunistic coral species, leading to simplified assemblages and reduced colour and diversity (Morais et al., 2023; GBRMPA, 2024).\nOutbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and increased prevalence of coral disease also contribute to localised coral degradation, while suspended sediment and nutrient runoff diminish water clarity, further eroding underwater visibility and the striking visual contrasts that define the reef\u2019s superlative beauty (GBRMPA, 2024).\nHuman perceptions of reef condition have shifted significantly in response to these visible changes. Visitor surveys and qualitative assessments following mass bleaching events have documented declining public ratings of reef condition and aesthetic value (GBRMPA, 2024). These changes not only affect tourism appeal but also diminish cultural connections to the reef.\nAbove water, island and coastal views remain largely intact, with lush rainforests, mangroves, and bright sand cays continuing to provide iconic scenery. However, sea-level rise and extreme weather events are increasing erosion and damaging some island vegetation and shoreline features. Overall, while many elements of visual grandeur persist, the underwater aesthetic, once among the most pristine and colourful globally, is undergoing steady decline, contributing to a deteriorating trend in this World Heritage value.\n#### Outstanding on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals\nCritical\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe 2024 GBR Outlook Report assessed ten key ecological processes and found four to be in \u2018poor\u2019 condition: predation, recruitment, symbiosis, and reef building. These are central to maintaining biodiversity and ecological complexity and have shown clear deterioration due to cumulative stress. Conversely, five processes: herbivory, microbial processes, particle feeding, competition, and connectivity were rated \u2018good\u2019, and one, primary production, was rated \u2018very good\u2019 (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThe decline in predation processes is largely linked to the depletion of apex predators, including sharks and rays, which have been rated as \u2018poor\u2019 in every GBR Outlook Report since 2009. The long history of fishing pressure continues to affect predator-prey dynamics and top-down regulation across ecosystems (GBRMPA, 2024). Recruitment is similarly impaired, especially for corals and some iconic species. Following the 2016\u20132017 bleaching events, coral larval recruitment fell by 89% compared to historical levels, and while partial recovery has occurred, resilience remains low (GBRMPA, 2019a; Hughes et al., 2019).\nPhysical and climatic stressors, particularly marine heatwaves, cyclones, and flooding, are also compromising ecological processes. All but one of the past 16 years has seen at least one major disturbance event. These events alter fundamental system processes such as connectivity and reef building and accelerate coral community shifts towards turf algae dominance (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThe structural complexity of coral communities is also reduced by disease and loss of symbiotic relationships. Symbiosis, a key process driving productivity and resilience on coral reefs, has deteriorated due to repeated thermal stress events that disrupt coral-zooxanthellae relationships. The shift to turf-dominated reef states is further disrupting microbial processes and nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling is now assessed as \u2018poor\u2019, largely due to chronic runoff of sediments and nutrients from land-based sources (GBRMPA, 2024).\nReef-building processes have weakened due to ocean acidification and bleaching. Ocean pH continues to decline, with increasing CO\u2082 uptake reducing carbonate availability for calcifying organisms. As a result, rates of coral growth and reef accretion have slowed, with consequences for coastal protection, habitat formation, and ecosystem resilience. Reef-building is expected to be particularly compromised if further warming and acidification proceed without significant mitigation (GBRMPA, 2024).\nOverall, the combined effect of these pressures is compromising the ecological integrity of the GBR. Ecological resilience is being lost, and the system&#039;s ability to maintain biodiversity and recover from disturbance is declining. Many of these changes are likely to persist for decades, even in the absence of additional shocks.\n#### Outstanding diversity of plants including mangroves and seagrass\nLow Concern\nTrend\nStable\nThe GBR supports a high diversity of coastal and marine plants, particularly mangroves and seagrasses, which are critical for ecological functions and biodiversity. Mangrove forests remain relatively stable across the region, contrasting with declining trends globally. Three new mangrove species have been identified in the Region since 2016 due to improved taxonomic resolution and range extensions, bringing the number of mangrove species to 37, representing over half of the world&#039;s diversity (GBRMPA, 2024).\nSeagrass meadows are more variable and sensitive to environmental change. Overall, shallow seagrass condition across the GBR is assessed as good but bordering on poor due to cumulative impacts. Temperature anomalies, nutrient inputs, cyclonic disturbance, and reduced water clarity from land-based runoff continue to stress seagrass ecosystems. In northern regions, the increase in colonising and successional species suggests a degree of recovery from earlier flooding impacts. However, southern areas such as the Fitzroy and Burnett Mary regions have shown limited recovery following disturbance events (GBRMPA, 2024).\nInformation on deep-water seagrass meadows remains limited, but modelled distributions suggest up to 40,000 km\u00b2 of potential habitat, with approximately 6,000 km\u00b2 of shallow coastal meadows actively monitored. These areas support key species such as dugongs and turtles, and their resilience is central to the broader ecological function of the reef.\nWhile seagrasses remain vulnerable to both chronic and acute stressors, including flood plumes and rising sea surface temperatures, regional variation in trends and partial recovery in northern regions support the conclusion that plant diversity remains in overall good condition (GBRMPA, 2024). The impacts of the extreme summer of 2023\u201324 remain to be fully assessed.\n#### Outstanding diversity of invertebrate species, including hard and soft corals\nCritical\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe invertebrate diversity of the GBR is exceptional, particularly its coral reef communities. However, these communities are facing widespread and increasing pressure from climate change, cumulative stressors, and human activities. Coral reefs, which form the foundation of this diversity, exhibit highly variable condition across the region, with significant differences between individual reefs and sectors (GBRMPA, 2024).\nWhile some reefs have shown recovery in hard coral cover since earlier bleaching events, these recoveries are often dominated by fast-growing and opportunistic species such as Acropora, which lack the ecological stability and complexity provided by slower-growing, competitive corals. This compositional shift results in simplified ecosystems with reduced resilience to further stress (Morais et al., 2023; GBRMPA, 2024).\nMass bleaching events in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2024 have led to substantial coral mortality, particularly among heat-sensitive branching and plate-forming species (GBRMPA, 2024). Some recovery has been observed following the 2020 and 2022 events, but the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves constrains the opportunity for coral communities to fully regenerate.\nNew molecular phylogenomic research is reshaping understanding of coral biogeography and taxonomy. Many species previously assumed to be widespread are now recognized as distinct endemics with small ranges, increasing concern for their conservation status (Bridge et al., 2024; Meziere et al., 2024; Rasmussen et al., 2025). Inshore reefs, in particular, may support highly divergent and undescribed species, especially in turbid, nearshore environments (Matias et al., 2023).\nIn addition to thermal stress, coral reefs face other pressures such as crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, declining water quality, and ocean acidification. The progressive decline in ocean pH due to increased CO\u2082 uptake continues to impact calcifying invertebrates, with implications for coral skeletal integrity and reef accretion processes. Culling of starfish has helped locally, but is not keeping pace with system-wide outbreaks (GBRMPA, 2024).\nBeyond corals, the GBR supports an extraordinary diversity of invertebrates including molluscs, echinoderms, sponges, crustaceans, bryozoans, and tunicates. The condition of these groups is not as well documented as corals, and many deep and cryptic species are poorly known. Notably, temperature stress has caused mass mortality events in other invertebrates, such as shrimp and crabs in the northern GBR (GBRMPA, 2019a).\nThere is growing concern over the continued harvest of wild hard corals from the World Heritage property, especially given the vulnerabilities and potential for species loss before formal description. Management agencies and scientists are increasingly debating a shift toward aquaculture-based coral supply to avoid contributing further pressure on wild populations.\n#### Outstanding diversity of fish including threatened species\nCritical\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe GBR supports over 1,600 species of fish from more than 130 families, including 136 species of sharks and rays, making it a global hotspot for chondrichthyan diversity (GBRMPA, 2024). However, this outstanding diversity is under pressure from multiple and interacting threats, including climate change, overfishing, habitat degradation, and insufficient monitoring and enforcement of fisheries regulations.\nCoral reef fish assemblages are being reshaped by coral mortality driven by repeated bleaching events. Loss of structural complexity following bleaching reduces shelter, feeding niches, and recruitment habitats for coral-dependent fish species, affecting their abundance, size structure, and community composition (GBRMPA, 2024). Some species are also experiencing sub-lethal physiological effects under rising temperatures, including impaired growth, development, and behaviour.\nFisheries management remains an area of high concern. Several commercially important fisheries stocks are assessed as depleted or overfished, including Spanish mackerel and snapper, and yet continue to be subject to fishing within the property (AMCS &amp; WWF, 2025). Queensland\u2019s Sustainable Fisheries Strategy has introduced some reforms, including harvest strategies and vessel monitoring systems, but the implementation of these reforms is uneven. For instance, electronic monitoring is progressing in the gillnet fishery, but independent validation in the trawl sector remains limited.\nClimate change is also altering fish distribution and reproductive biology. Shifts in spawning times, reduced larval survival, and skewed sex ratios have been reported in some species. Functional shifts in fish communities are evident, with increasing dominance of herbivorous and generalist species at the expense of specialists, affecting trophic dynamics and ecosystem resilience.\nDespite these challenges, some conservation actions have yielded positive signs. For example, the protection of hammerhead sharks through no-take declarations and new listings under conservation legislation has improved regulatory safeguards. However, sustained recovery will require stronger monitoring, compliance, and habitat protection.\nIn summary, while the GBR continues to support globally significant fish diversity, particularly in terms of reef fishes and chondrichthyans, ongoing declines in habitat quality, emerging challenges in implementing fisheries reforms, and climate stressors indicate that this World Heritage value is at high risk.\n#### Threatened reptiles\nHigh Concern\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nSome significant declines in ecologically important species such as marine turtles have been reported (GBRMPA, 2009; 2014, 2024). Key threats include climate change, marine debris, national and international take, terrestrial predation, fisheries bycatch and light pollution.\nResearch into green turtle populations show declining annual average size of breeding females, increasing re-migration interval and declining proportion of older adult turtles to the population (Limpus et al., 2003; Brodie and Waterhouse, 2012). There are serious concerns about the northern population of the green turtle in the GBR, as a study has shown an extreme female-bias (99.1% of juveniles) in this population due to the impacts of rising temperatures affecting the sex ratio of hatchlings, with warmer incubation temperatures increasing the proportion of female hatchlings. The study concluded that a complete feminization of this population was possible in the near future (Jensen et al., 2018). However, the southern green turtle population has been reported to continue to recover (State Party of Australia, 2019). Similarly, eastern Queensland flatback turtles have shown moderate recovery in the GBR. High concerns remain, however, for the future of loggerhead and hawksbill turtle populations (State Party of Australia, 2022). The nesting population of hawksbill turtles is in significant decline and could be at risk of loss within the next 10 to 15 years (GBRMPA, 2024).\nSea snakes appear relatively abundant in some areas, but some localised depletions of some sea snake populations have been reported (GBRMPA, 2019a). The lack of systematic population monitoring means the status of sea snakes in the GBR Region remains uncertain. Based on the limited available evidence, the condition of sea snakes in the region is inferred to be stable (GBRMPA, 2024).\n#### Bird diversity\nHigh Concern\nTrend\nDeteriorating\nThe GBR region supports breeding populations of 21 seabird species, all of which are protected under the EPBC Act (GBRMPA, 2024). There are 55 key locations for nesting and roosting seabirds that are regionally and globally important. Most support multiple species of seabirds, and many (65 per cent) are in the GBR\u2019s southern section. Overall, 39 of the 55 sites (71 per cent) are globally significant as they meet, individually or as a group, specific criteria, such as supporting greater than one per cent of the global population size of a species, over a season, and during one or more life history stages. The remaining 16 sites (29 per cent), which do not meet global significance criteria, are regionally significant as they support, for example, seabird species that are geographically restricted in their nesting area.\nTen highly diverse seabird rookeries occur within the GBR, where populations of seven or more species nest on islands and cays, including the most diverse, Raine Island (13 to 17 species). Some species inhabit the GBR region year-round, while others migrate to distant foraging grounds where they remain for large parts of the year. As migratory seabirds depend on resources both at sea and on land, they are exposed to impacts in both environments and in multiple locations. The main threats to seabirds include the impacts of changes in sea surface temperature on food supplies, fishing impacts on prey species, direct disturbance by visitors and ingestion of marine debris (GBRMPA, 2019a).\nLong-term trend analyses published in 2021 of populations of nine seabird species from 32 of the reef\u2019s islands and cays found that trends varied markedly among species and sites from 1979 to 2018 (Saraux et al, 2021). Overall, population declines were detected in 39 out of 86 assessed species and site combinations (45 per cent), followed by \u2018no change\u2019 in 31 (41 per cent) and increases in 12 combinations (14 per cent). Although available information on population trends is highly site-specific, probable declines are occurring in some species, while other species\u2019 populations appear static or have probable increases (GBRMPA, 2024).\nThe condition (and trend in condition) of shorebirds in the GBR region have been assessed as poor (the same as in 2014 and 2019). Migratory and resident shorebird species are subject to local pressures, such as disturbance and habitat decline, while migratory shorebirds are vulnerable to habitat loss outside the region during their migration. The potential for the H5N1 avian flu to enter Australia and devastate bird populations in the World Heritage property is a great concern.\n#### Threatened marine mammals\nHigh Concern\nTrend\nStable\nThe GBR has a globally significant population of dugongs which contribute to the OUV of the property. Dugongs are also culturally significant to many coastal Indigenous peoples in Australia. Overall, dugong populations in the GBR are assessed as poor but there is no consistent trend (GBRMPA, 2024). In the GBR region north of Cape Bedford, dugong populations are considered stable, if not increasing. However, there is evidence of a long-term decline in dugong populations to the south between 2005 and 2022. Key impacts on dugongs include direct pressures causing mortality, such as incidental catch, vessel strikes, marine debris, traditional hunting and illegal fishing. Indirect pressures, including loss or degradation of seagrass habitats, can severely and acutely deplete dugong populations because the reduced food availability delays reproduction and ultimately causes starvation (GBRMPA, 2024).\nApproximately 15 species of whale and 18 species of dolphin occur within the GBR region (GBRMPA, 2024). The two most commonly encountered whale species are the humpback and the dwarf minke whales, both of which are economically important to the region, as reliable and extremely popular tourist attractions. The east Australian humpback whale population is one of the largest humpback populations globally. Threats to individual whales while they migrate through the GBR include entanglement in fishing and shark-control nets, ship strikes and underwater noise (Smith et al, 2020); outside the GBR the biggest threat is changes in food availability in the southern oceans due to climate change and over-harvesting of krill.\nFour dolphin species are known to reside in the GBR year-round. The spinner dolphin is found throughout the region; the other three species (Australian snubfin dolphin, Australian humpback dolphin, and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin), inhabit inshore waters. Another 14 species are occasionally sighted in the outer waters of the GBR. Overall, due to multiple and cumulative threats, populations of some dolphin species within the region are inferred to have continued deteriorating since 2019. There are no region-wide abundance assessments for Australian humpback and snubfin dolphins, and estimates for discrete populations show they occur in generally low numbers (less than 150 individuals) at low densities. Population sizes of other dolphins in GBR waters are unknown.\n[Summary of values](#bootstrap-panel--11--content)\nAssessment of the current state and trend of World Heritage values\n[Critical](https://worldheritageoutlook.iucn.org/taxonomy/term/1349)\nDeteriorating\nThe World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef remain under serious pressure, with multiple values assessed as degraded and trending negatively, particularly those reliant on biological integrity and ecological processes. While some attributes such as geological formations, large-scale biological phenomena, and aspects of scenic beauty remain largely intact and continue to support the site\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), they are increasingly vulnerable to escalating and compounding threats, most notably climate change. The reef has experienced repeated mass coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024, along with intensified cyclonic activity and flooding. These extreme events are undermining ecological stability and resilience across broad spatial scales. Fundamental ecological processes such as recruitment, reef building, and predation are increasingly compromised by climate-driven disturbances, with many assessed as poor or deteriorating. The biological diversity of the reef is also in decline amid concerns that coral assemblages may be shifting toward fast-growing, disturbance-tolerant species, which reduce overall functional and taxonomic diversity. However, while this might be true in some areas, there is not yet comprehensive evidence of such community structure changes at larger scales, such as a whole individual reef or the whole Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. Iconic and threatened species, including marine turtles, dugongs, some seabird populations, and sharks, are declining in condition, reproductive success, or range. Coral reef fish communities are being restructured by habitat degradation, fisheries pressure, and impacts from warming waters. These changes suggest declining ecological function and reduced ecosystem resilience. While mangrove condition remains relatively stable, seagrasses in some regions have not recovered from recent disturbance, and deep-water meadow condition remains largely unknown. The reef\u2019s aesthetic and scenic values remain globally significant, but are being diminished by coral bleaching, algal overgrowth, and reduced habitat complexity. Visitor perceptions of the reef\u2019s natural beauty have declined in the aftermath of recent bleaching events, reflecting both real and perceived losses in visual quality. Geological and physical features\u2014such as reef structure, island-cay systems, and sedimentary dynamics\u2014remain robust and continue to demonstrate the values for which the site was inscribed under Criterion (viii). However, their long-term resilience may be affected by accelerating sea level rise and ocean acidification, particularly in relation to reef accretion and carbonate balance.\nAssessment of the current state and trend of other important values\nHigh Concern\nStable\nAs outlined in [1. Values], the Retrospective SOUV for the GBRWHA provides clear recognition of cultural values by virtue of the approved OUV wording. First Nations peoples are increasingly reasserting their role in Land and Sea Country management and the protection of Indigenous heritage across the GBR Region. Indigenous heritage is living heritage which First Nations people continue to practice, providing meaning to everyday life and contributing to the ongoing wellbeing of communities. The condition and trend of many Indigenous Heritage Values are tied closely to those of natural heritage values. However, three of the four grouping of Indigenous values assessed in the 2024 GBR Outlook Report have been assessed as &#039;poor&#039; (GBRMPA, 2024). These three groupings include (1) Sacred sites, sites of particular significance and places important for cultural tradition; (2) Stories, songlines, totems and languages; and (3) Indigenous structures, technology, tools and archaeology. Two major factors contributing to these poor assessments are the loss of Indigenous knowledge, including oral traditions held by Elders, and pressures that affect populations of totemic species or break connections across Land and Sea Country.\n### Additional information\n[Benefits](#bootstrap-panel--15--content)\n[Understanding benefits](#bootstrap-panel--13--content)\nOutdoor recreation and tourism,\nNatural beauty and scenery\nThe Great Barrier Reef contributes significantly to the Australian economy, to First Nations peoples who depend on it for traditional use, social and cultural purposes, and to the livelihoods, wellbeing and lifestyles of local communities. Commercial marine tourism, fishing, ports and shipping are economically significant uses of the waters within the property. The impacts of tourism and ports are localised to a few well-managed areas; by contrast, fishing occurs throughout the GBR Region.\nThe direct and indirect value-added contribution to the Australian economy was estimated at AU$6.4 billion in 2015-16; noting, however, the COVID-19 pandemic and border restrictions did impact these values. The 2015-16 assessment included AU$5.7 billion from the tourism industry, $346 million from recreational activities and AU$199 million from commercial fishing and aquaculture. This economic activity generates about 64,000 jobs, mostly in the tourism industry, which takes over 2 million tourists to the GBR each year. These industries, and their flow-on activities, underpin a significant and growing proportion of Queensland\u2019s regional economy (Deloitte, 2017). A wide variety of recreational activities occur in the region, and popular destinations include islands and reefs. Visits to the region by catchment residents are increasing, likely tied to local population growth and people visiting more frequently. The number of recreational vessel registrations in 2018 to 2022 was the highest recorded and has increased in proportion to population growth in the adjoining catchment areas.\nA healthy Great Barrier Reef provides material and non-material benefits to people which result in wellbeing outcomes. These benefits accrue to people that interact with the reef, through livelihoods, relaxation and enjoyment and, in turn, influence mental and physical health and prosperity. These benefits also affect people remotely: from the reef\u2019s prominence in the Australian national identity and further afield to the intrinsic value of the existence of the Reef as a world heritage treasure for humanity\nFactors negatively affecting provision of this benefit\nClimate change\nImpact level - High\nTrend - Increasing\nPollution\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nOverexploitation\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nInvasive species\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nHabitat change\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nImportance for research,\nContribution to education,\nCollection of genetic material\nThe Great Barrier Reef is of strong scientific interest due to its high biological and ecological diversity, geomorphology, and broad heritage values (natural, Indigenous, and post-contact heritage values). Scientific research and education activities have made, and continues to make, a critical contribution to the way the region is understood, managed and used. Research on the GBR has global significance and is of value to the understanding and management of coral reefs and marine protected areas beyond Australia. A range of academic institutions, government agencies and foundations undertake research in and about the Great Barrier Reef, providing income and employment in regional communities. These include:\n\u2022Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS)\n\u2022Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA)\n\u2022GBR Foundation\n\u2022A network of four island research stations (Lizard Island, Orpheus Island, Heron Island and One Tree Island).\nIn 2015\u201316, AU$130 million of revenue was generated by the above organisations through the conduct of scientific research, reef management and related activities. They spent AU$57 million and AU$65 million on employment and intermediate inputs respectively. The total value of scientific research and reef management associated with the GBR in 2015\u201316 is around AU$182 million contributed to the Australian economy (Deloitte Access Economics, 2017).\nFrom 2018 to 2020, the annual number of research permits operating in the GBR Region increased from 219 to 335; this number remained generally stable in 2021 and 2022.\nFactors negatively affecting provision of this benefit\nClimate change\nImpact level - High\nTrend - Increasing\nPollution\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nOverexploitation\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nInvasive species\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nHabitat change\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nHistory and tradition,\nSacred natural sites or landscapes,\nSacred or symbolic plants or animals,\nCultural identity and sense of belonging\nFirst Nations peoples are increasingly reasserting their role in the management and protection of Land and Sea Country across the GBR Region. Traditional Owners\u2019 connection to Country within the region continues to be practised and maintained according to traditional customs and spiritual lore, reflecting ongoing stewardship and custodianship. Indigenous heritage is living heritage, which First Nations people continue to practice, providing meaning to everyday life and contributing to the ongoing wellbeing of communities.\nThe condition and trend of many Indigenous Heritage Values are tied closely to those of natural heritage values. Many Traditional Owners use marine resources to practise their sustainable \u2018living maritime culture\u2019, provide traditional food for families, and educating younger generations about traditional and cultural rules, protocols and activities in Country (GBRMPA, 2014). However, three of the four grouping of Indigenous values assessed in the 2024 GBR Outlook Report have been rated as &#039;poor&#039; (GBRMPA, 2024). These three groupings include (1) Sacred sites, sites of particular significance and places important for cultural tradition; (2) Stories, song-lines, totems and languages; and (3) Indigenous structures, technology, tools and archaeology. Two major factors contributing to these poor assessments are the loss of Indigenous knowledge, including oral traditions held by Elders; and pressures that affect populations of totemic species or break connections across Land and Sea Country.\nFactors negatively affecting provision of this benefit\nClimate change\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nPollution\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nOverexploitation\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nInvasive species\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nHabitat change\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nFishing areas and conservation of fish stocks\nRecreational and commercial fishing both occur in the GBR but are regulated. Commercial fishing and aquaculture in and adjacent to the region generate about AU$199 million per year (Deloitte Access Economics, 2017). Recreational fishing continues to be one of the most popular pastimes in the region. Some areas within the GBR World Heritage site provide important nursery grounds for a number of commercially valuable species. Traditional use of marine resources continues to provide environmental, social, economic and cultural benefits to Traditional Owners and their sea country.\nFactors negatively affecting provision of this benefit\nClimate change\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nPollution\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nOverexploitation\nImpact level - Moderate\nTrend - Increasing\nInvasive species\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\nHabitat change\nImpact level - Low\nTrend - Increasing\n[Summary of benefits](#bootstrap-panel--14--content)\nThe large size of the Great Barrier Reef supports a wide variety of uses, which in turn provide a wide array of benefits to the people living both within and outside the World Heritage property. In addition to nature conservation and conserving cultural values, the Great Barrier Reef provides a wide range of ecosystem services, furnishes a wealth of scientific knowledge and provides jobs through tourism, fishing, park management, research and education. Local populations can benefit from traditional, recreational and commercial fishing and some limited hunting (some Traditional Owners continue to hunt turtle and dugong) provided that it is sustainable. Economic benefits of tourism associated with the Great Barrier Reef are substantial, however, the extent to which these activities have recovered following the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be determined.\n[Projects](#bootstrap-panel--17--content)\n[Compilation of active conservation projects](#bootstrap-panel--16--content)\n|&#x2116;|Organization|Brief description of Active Projects|Website|\n1|GBRMPA; Reef and Rainforest Research Centre (RRRC); Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO); various universities including James Cook University|Removal of crown-of-thorns starfish and research into management of outbreaks of this pest species.|\nhttp://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/our-programs-and-projects/crown-of-thorns-starfish-management\n|\n2|Various organizations, including the Australian Institute of Marine Science, CSIRO, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, the University of Queensland, QUT, Southern Cross University and James Cook University.|In 2018, the Australian Government funded the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) consortium to determine the feasibility of intervening at scale on the Great Barrier Reef to help it adapt to, and recover from, the effects of climate change. The program scoped existing and novel approaches that could help support the resilience of the Reef. The feasibility study found no single silver bullet solution and delivered an investment case for further research and development of reef interventions. A range of methods are needed to work together to provide compounding benefits, along with ongoing best-practice Reef management and reducing carbon emissions. The second phase of the RRAP (2020 to 2024) is an accelerated research and development program into the prospective techniques. Since 2019, investigations have progressively developed and field-tested different technologies, including cooling and shading methods, assisted adaptation of Reef species, and supporting natural rehabilitation of damaged and degraded reefs. The program also includes complementary research across a range of subprograms, including assessing the feasibility of implementation at scale, modelling and decision support, and stakeholder engagement and regulation. The program has led to changes in the nature and scale of research conducted on the Reef. The goal of the RRAP is to provide reef managers and decision-makers with an innovative suite of safe, acceptable and cost-effective interventions. The next phase is envisaged to be an implementation phase that will overlap with the research and development phase as early as 2025, depending on the specific intervention. This implementation phase may include commercial transfer of some of the intervention measures, including the construction, operation and deployment of full-scale systems. In 2024, some uncertainty remains about the pathway to implementation. However, it should be underpinned by sound science, calibrated against a range of risk factors (including inaction), consider ethics and the social and cultural acceptability, and be cost effective (GBRMPA, 2024). Additional funding has been confirmed as per advice to the Reef Advisory Committee in April 2025 (IUCN Consultation, 2025).|\nhttps://gbrrestoration.org/\n|\n3|GBRMPA, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol, Queensland Water Police, Maritime Border Command.|The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, through the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, operate a joint field management program for the marine parks (the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park) and island national parks within the GBR Region|\nhttp://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/field-management\n|\n4|GBRMPA and interested citizen scientists|The \u2018Eye on the Reef\u2019 program is a citizen-science monitoring and assessment program that enables anyone who visits the Great Barrier Reef (whether they are a regular day tripper, a tourist, a fisher, park ranger, marine tourism staff or even a marine scientist) to readily collect valuable information about reef health, marine animals sighting and incidents. The information is easily collated by downloading the free Eye on the Reef app. The app includes comprehensive zoning maps, and also an interactive Sightings Network map allowing anyone in the world to see the amazing wildlife being encountered and recorded by visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. There are also other monitoring programs for people who visit the Reef more regularly, have more time or marine biology knowledge, or are willing to be part of \u2018Eye on the Reef\u2019 training. All the above information is used to better understand the GBR as well as contributing to its long-term protection and management.|\nhttps://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/programs-and-projects/eye-on-the-reef/what-is-eye-on-the-reef\n|\n5|GBRMPA; Local Government Councils; over 380 schools (primary and secondary)|The Reef Guardian Stewardship program began in 2003, when the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority started working closely with schools to encourage the community to take action for a healthier Reef. The Reef Guardian School program encourages teachers and students to take actions that help protect the Great Barrier Reef and its connected ecosystems. The Reef Guardian Schools initiative currently has more than 380 schools, 13,200 teachers and 216,000 students involved in building the Reef\u2019s resilience. Since the program\u2019s inception in 2003, more than 350,000 students have attended Reef Guardian School program. In 2007 the Reef Guardian initiative was expanded to include local government councils along the GBR coast. The Reef Guardian Council program acknowledges that local government councils are directly involved in a myriad of both statutory and non-statutory activities that minimise impacts, improve values and support the resilience of the Reef. Local governments are key management partners as many of the threats to the GBR and heritage values arise outside of the Marine Park boundaries and the Reef Authority\u2019s jurisdiction. The Reef Guardian Councils program supports the important role of local government in the protection and management of the adjoining catchment region.|\nhttps://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/programs-and-projects/reef-guardians https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/programs-and-projects/reef-guardian-councils\n|\n6|GBRMPA, Maritime Safety Queensland, Australian Maritime Safety Authority|The Douglas Shoal Environmental Remediation Project was an innovative and large-scale reef restoration program in response to the grounding of the coal ship Shen Neng 1 in 2010. As this was the largest ship grounding ever to occur on the GBR, the overall response to this grounding has some significant but also some disturbing lessons. The initial incident response was relatively well handled, with the ship removed from the reef and three assessments undertaken of the impact area within a month. However, this was then followed by a regrettable combination of international political differences and uncertainties, legal disputes, remoteness, logistical delays, operational difficulties and various personnel, which resulted in considerable delays in the clean-up of the area. The remediation project was initiated after a financial settlement with the ship\u2019s owners and insurers in 2016,. The project identified that bulk removal of ship-grounding-generated rubble and antifouling paint contamination was likely the best solution to promote natural recovery of the shoal. The Reef Authority conducted surveys and logistical planning with consultants and pre-remediation monitoring and turbidity plume modelling in the lead-up to remediation activities on Douglas Shoal. In early September 2023, the Reef Authority\u2019s primary remediation contractor undertook targeted remediation of Douglas Shoal using a specialised trailing suction hopper dredge vessel. Subsequent underwater sonar and ROV surveys indicate successful removal of ship-grounding-generated rubble, with minimal impact to adjacent high value marine benthic habitats. The unfortunate consequence of 13 years between the grounding and the remediation efforts means that an unknown amount of antifoulant paint that initially impacted Douglas Shoal will never be recovered, having subsequently been eroded over the years and dispersed by the very strong tidal currents over a broader area. Whatever antifouling paint that remained on Douglas Shoal was removed and deposited into specially designed and constructed ponds on land leased from the Gladstone Ports Corporation. In early 2025, the necessary dewatering and onshore project activities were still being finalised.|\nhttps://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/programs-and-projects/douglas-shoal-environmental-remediation-project https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/browse?type=series&amp;&amp;value=Douglas+Shoal+Remediation+Project&amp;&amp;sort\\_by=2&amp;&amp;order=DESC&amp;&amp;rpp=50&amp;&amp;etal=0&amp;&amp;submit\\_browse=Update\n|\n## References\n|&#x2116;|References|\n1|\nAIMS (2024).

It contains more than 2,500 individual reefs, coral shoals, and islands, showcasing diverse shapes and structures, including platform and wall reefs. Home to an impressive array of biodiversity, the reef supports around 1,500 to 2,000 fish species, over 4,000 species of mollusks, and approximately 400 coral species, with significant variations influenced by nutrient levels and freshwater inputs.\n\nThe reef ecosystem thrives in a tropical climate characterized by complex current patterns, with significant ecological zones shaped by factors such as cyclones and seasonal temperature variations. Human activities, including commercial fishing, agricultural runoff, and climate change, pose substantial threats to the reef's health, leading to issues like coral bleaching and overfishing. Legal protections exist through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, established in 1975, which aims to safeguard the reef while allowing for sustainable use.\n\nDespite its protected status, the reef faces challenges from environmental stresses exacerbated by human impact. This has prompted UNESCO to consider listing it as \"in danger\" due to severe coral bleaching events linked to rising ocean temperatures. The Great Barrier Reef is not only a vital marine ecosystem but also a UNESCO World Heritage site, reflecting its significance and the urgent need for conservation efforts.\n\n**Published in**: 2024\n\n**By**: Gutierrez, Lucia M.\n\n[Go to EBSCOhost](https://openurl.ebsco.com/results?sid=ebsco%3Aebsco.com%3ARS&bquery=Great%20Barrier%20Reef%20ecosystem&link_origin=https%3A//www.ebsco.com) and sign in to access more content about this topic.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- [Australia](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/geography-and-cartography/australia)\n- [Continental drift](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/continental-drift)\n- [Cyclones and Anticyclones](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/cyclones-and-anticyclones)\n- [Monsoons](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/monsoons)\n- [Biodiversity](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/science/biodiversity)\n- [Coral reefs and seagrass beds](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/zoology/coral-reefs-and-seagrass-beds)\n- [Deforestation](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/deforestation)\n- [Oil spills](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/oil-spills)\n- [Bleaching of Coral Reefs](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/bleaching-coral-reefs)\n- [Crown-of-thorns starfish](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/crown-thorns-starfish)\n- [Ocean life and rising water temperatures](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biology/ocean-life-and-rising-water-temperatures)\n- [Zooplankton](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biology/zooplankton)\n- [Climate change and global warming](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/climate-change-and-global-warming)\n- [Ocean acidification](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/ocean-acidification)\n- [World Heritage Sites](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/law/world-heritage-sites)\n\n## On this Page\n\n- [Climate and Currents](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/great-barrier-reef-ecosystem#climate-and-currents)\n- [Biodiversity](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/great-barrier-reef-ecosystem#biodiversity)\n- [Human Interaction](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/great-barrier-reef-ecosystem#human-interaction)\n- [Bibliography](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/great-barrier-reef-ecosystem#bibliography)\n\n## Subject Terms\n\n- [Marine resources conservation](https://openurl.ebsco.com/results?sid=ebsco%3Aebsco.com%3ARS&bquery=Marine%20resources%20conservation&link_origin=https%3A//www.ebsco.com)\n- [Ecosystems](https://openurl.ebsco.com/results?sid=ebsco%3Aebsco.com%3ARS&bquery=Ecosystems&link_origin=https%3A//www.ebsco.com)\n- [Great Barrier Reef](https://openurl.ebsco.com/results?sid=ebsco%3Aebsco.com%3ARS&bquery=Great%20Barrier%20Reef&link_origin=https%3A//www.ebsco.com)\n\n# Great Barrier Reef ecosystem\n\n**Summary:** The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world, extending more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) along the northeastern coast of Australia.\n\n**Category:** Marine and Oceanic Biomes\n\n**Geographic Location:** Australia\n\n[Australia](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/geography-and-cartography/australia), an island continent with an extensive tropical coastline and 17 percent of the world's total area of reefs, has the world's largest total area of coral reefs after Indonesia. Conditions for reef development vary considerably along the island's coastline. The Great Barrier Reef runs along the northeastern coastline of Australia, extending out to the margins of the continental shelf, from the Warrior Reefs in the northern Torres Strait for well over 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) to the Capricorn-Bunker Group of reefs and islands in the south.\n\n![94981365-89396.jpg](https://imageserver.ebscohost.com/img/embimages/ers/sp/embedded/94981365-89396.jpg?ephost1=dGJyMNHX8kSepq84xNvgOLCmsE2epq5Srqa4SK6WxWXS)![94981365-89395.jpg](https://imageserver.ebscohost.com/img/embimages/ers/sp/embedded/94981365-89395.jpg?ephost1=dGJyMNHX8kSepq84xNvgOLCmsE2epq5Srqa4SK6WxWXS)\n\nThis reef system, extending to Papua New Guinea, actually consists of more than 2,500 individual reefs, coral shoals, and high island fringing reefs, which can range in size from scarcely visible to over 39 square miles (101 square kilometers). The shape and structure of the individual reefs are also of great variety. Two main categories have been defined: lying platform or patch reefs, resulting from radial growth; and wall reefs, resulting from elongated growth, often in areas of strong water currents. There are approximately 300 coral cays, including those with vegetation or not, and over 40 low-wooded islands. There are also 618 continental islands that were once part of the mainland.\n\n[Continental drift](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/continental-drift) brought the northern coastline of Australia into tropical latitudes about two million years ago, when the Great Barrier Reef originated with some minor development, but widespread reef development is thought to have begun about 500,000 years ago.\n\n## Climate and Currents\n\nComplex patterns of currents in Australian waters are key driving forces and contribute to the different ecological areas within the region. The Great Barrier Reef, bounded by the Coral Sea to the east and the Torres Strait to the north, is characterized by the counterclockwise gyre of the South Equatorial current. [Cyclones](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/cyclones-and-anticyclones) are seasonally common here in this tropical marine climate. Air temperatures vary between an average maximum of approximately 86 degrees F (30 degrees C) in January and 73 degrees F (23 degrees C) in July, and an average minimum of approximately 74 degrees F (24 degrees C) in January and 64 degrees F (18 degrees C) in July. Mean water surface temperature is at a maximum during February and at a minimum during July.\n\nCurrent patterns across the continental shelf induce localized upwelling and are predominantly driven by prevailing southeast trade winds, northwest [monsoons](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/monsoons), and patterns of tidal flow.\n\nThe continental shelf of Australia's northern shores connects across the relatively shallow waters of the Torres Strait to Papua New Guinea, which loads considerable freshwater and sediments into the strait. The westernmost areas have the shallowest and most turbid waters, and soft mud dominates the shallow surface of the reefs in the area. The easternmost areas of the strait are characterized by fringing corals. There are very extensive platform reefs around Darnley Island, stretching out toward the edge of the continental shelf and a nearly continuous line of reefs. This particular section of reefs marks the northern edge of the outer Great Barrier Reef. The northern section of the Great Barrier Reef is unique, with well-developed ribbon-type barrier reefs on the outer edge and wide areas of shoals, banks, and fringing reefs.\n\nThe southernmost reefs of the Great Barrier Reef are known as the Capricorn-Bunker Group and are a little more than 30 miles (50 kilometers) offshore south of the Swain Reefs Complex. At this relatively small reef complex, the continental shelf narrows rapidly, with steeply sloping reef edges, deep waters, shallow lagoons, and well-developed coral cays. The best-known reefs of the entire Great Barrier Reef system are at One Tree Island at the Tropic of Capricorn, whose cooler waters are largely responsible for the lower coral diversities in these islands.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef has very high levels of [biodiversity](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/science/biodiversity), with some 1,500 to 2,000 species of fish, more than 4,000 species of mollusks, and 400 coral species. The high number of coral species decreases toward higher latitudes, with the number decreasing to about 240 species in the southern sections. The differences in the higher levels of nutrient loads, sediments, and amounts of freshwater present near the mainland, and the low inputs on the outer reefs, have led to considerable variation in species assemblages in different locations. Fish populations tend to be relatively small, in that the waters of the Great Barrier Reef are generally nutrient-poor. Some nutrients are supplied by Coral Sea surface water and upwellings, and also by terrestrial runoff. Tidal mixing is a major contributor to the nutrient recycling dynamics of this ecoregion.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef serves as a nesting ground for green, hawksbill, loggerhead, and flatback sea turtles. Raine Island and Pandora Cay are the largest breeding grounds for green turtles, whereas islands in the northern section of the area are nesting sites for hawksbill turtles. About twenty-six species of cetaceans are found within the region, with frequent reports of humpback, minke, and killer whales, and of bottlenose, spinner, and Irrawaddy river dolphins. Humpbacks breed along the east coast of Australia in winter, between July and October.\n\nThere are some twenty-three species of breeding birds on more than fifty-five major nesting islands in the northern and southern sections of the Great Barrier Reef, with most bird communities reported in the Capricorn-Bunker Group. Raine Island is a major seabird rookery. Saltwater crocodiles are found in mangrove swamps and river estuaries along the region's coastal fringe, but individuals are seen around offshore coral reefs. Giant clams are also common in the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nSeagrass and mangrove communities are notably important in the Great Barrier Reef, as they are breeding and nursing grounds for many reef and marine species. [Seagrass beds](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/zoology/coral-reefs-and-seagrass-beds) are important for marine turtles and provide breeding grounds for significant numbers of dugongs. Seagrass beds both shallow and deep\u2014as much as 49 feet (15 meters) below the surface\u2014are widespread, with an estimate of at least 1,930 square miles (5,000 square kilometers) of cover. The largest known populations of dugongs occur in the northern and southern sections of the Great Barrier Reef region, but the southern groups are declining due to an increase in the number of boat collisions and entanglement in gill nets and shark nets placed near swimming beaches. Mangroves, for the most part, are located away from coral reef communities; some mangroves have been recorded on a few fringing reef systems, with the highest levels of diversity north of Cairns.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the site of a mass spawning event that takes place once a year for a few nights after a particular full moon in the late austral spring, when the majority of stony corals, sponges, sea cucumbers, marine worms, and giant clams reproduce, releasing eggs and sperm in synchronicity. Occurring globally, mass spawning on coral reefs allows cross-fertilization between colonies and increases the chances of survival of individual larvae.\n\n## Human Interaction\n\nThe types of fishing activities that are popular in the Great Barrier Reef are recreational fishing of groupers, emperors, lobsters, fish for the aquarium trade, sea cucumbers, and trochus; and trawling of fish, prawns, scallops, and crustaceans. Repetitive trawling and the size of bycatch have become major concerns associated with trawling activities, as 50 percent to 90 percent of hauls typically include unusable species of benthic (deepwater) organisms as well as fish, sea snakes, and turtles. Illegal trawling often occurs in some of the protected reef areas and seagrass communities. Other destructive fishing practices have threatened the health of the Great Barrier Reef, including cyanide fishing, blast fishing, and muro-ami, which involves banging on reefs with sticks or blocks of cement to scare fish from their hiding places into nets.\n\nReef health varies, depending on the type and location of reefs, local conditions, and the effect of anthropogenic activities. For a long time, the Great Barrier Reef was not heavily affected by human activities, as the majority of reefs are far offshore, but the effects of human activity can be seen on reefs closest to the mainland. Increases in human activities such as [deforestation](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/deforestation), poor agricultural practices, high concentrations of agricultural chemicals, nutrients in terrestrial runoff, land-based sediments, overgrazing, [oil spills](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/oil-spills), intensive recreational use, and commercial fisheries are of major and immediate concern.\n\nCyclones, [bleaching events](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/bleaching-coral-reefs), and coral predators such as the [crown-of-thorns starfish](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/crown-thorns-starfish) have devastating effects on reef structure and development. Bleaching\u2014which can be caused by environmental stress and [seawater temperature rise](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biology/ocean-life-and-rising-water-temperatures)\u2014occurs when corals expel zooxanthellae, a unicellular flagellate (that is photosynthetic), with which the coral have a symbiotic relationship. This expulsion causes a bleached or whitened appearance, and can eventually lead to the decline in the health of the coral. In 2016, the Great Barrier Reef region experienced a widespread bleaching event due to substantially warmer ocean temperatures than usual, in large part due to the effects of climate change. Factors such as changes in salinity, decreases in [zooplankton](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biology/zooplankton) (caused by fishing), changes in water temperatures, bacterial infections, and [climate change](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/climate-change-and-global-warming) due to global warming are all associated with human activity. Both bleaching events and outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish may be human-induced. The starfish predation of coral is of greatest concern in Australia because of the potential economic effect. The first outbreak of the crown-of-thorns starfish was observed on Green Island, off Cairns, in 1962, but most outbreaks have been recorded in the central sections of the Great Barrier Reef. Evidence suggests that increased soil runoff may aggravate outbreaks and in some instances may cause them. [Ocean acidification](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/earth-and-atmospheric-sciences/ocean-acidification) due to climate change and the increased uptake of carbon dioxide by the world's oceans will increasingly restrict coral growth and survival. Because of higher-than-average temperatures, a survey of the reef conducted in 2022 found that 91 percent of the reef was affected by coral bleaching.\n\nThe great majority of Australia's reefs fall within protected areas. Most of the lagoons, and all offshore reefs from the Capricorn-Bunker Group to the northern section of Cape York Peninsula receive legal protection as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, managed since 1975 by the federal Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) and the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. The remaining coastal waters and offshore islands fall within other protected areas.\n\nThe marine park has a detailed zoning plan of its 133,205 square miles (345,000 square kilometers), providing areas of strict protection alongside much larger areas of multiple use. About 80 percent of its total area is open for general use, including permitted commercial fishing and trawling, and a further 16 percent is open for general use but no trawling. Only about 5 percent is closed to fishing activities, but this area includes more than 120 reefs, and there are 13 fisheries habitat reserves. The reefs of the Torres Strait are outside the jurisdiction of the Great Barrier Reef and thus do not fall under its legal protection, but a fisheries management agreement with Papua New Guinea offers these reefs some kind of loose protection. The Great Barrier Reef has been a [World Heritage Site](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/law/world-heritage-sites) since 1981. In 2021, UNESCO proposed listing the Great Barrier Reef as being \"in danger\" due to severe coral bleaching caused by unusually high temperatures in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2022. However, the Australian government was mostly against the listing because it might decrease revenues generated from tourism. Because of the coral bleaching, the reef was also in danger of losing its status as a World Heritage Site. The United Nations planned to study the extent of the damage in 2022, but a meeting to discuss the issue was canceled when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nArup, Tom. \"Great Barrier Reef Coral Bleaching More Widespread than First Thought, Surveys Reveal.\" _Sydney Morning Herald_, 31 Mar. 2016, www.smh.com.au/environment/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-more-widespread-than-first-thought-surveys-reveal-20160331-gnux7x.html.

It is the world's most extensive coral reef system.\n\nThe Reef covers an area of 348,000 square kilometres. It is so large it can be seen from space.\n\nMillions of people visit the Reef every year. Another one million people are lucky enough to live in the region.\n\nThe Reef is part of Australia\u2019s national identity. It is inextricably linked to the heritage of Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples, the oldest, continuous culture on Earth.\n\nThe Reef was inscribed on the UNSECO World Heritage List in 1981. It was inscribed for its unique natural attributes and enormous scientific and environmental importance.\n\nIt is one of 29 natural, marine properties on the World Heritage List that contain coral reef systems.\n\nClimate change is the greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. It requires a global solution.\n\nThe Reef is one of the best managed World Heritage properties. Australia has a strong planning and investment framework in place to address key threats for the Reef.\n\nAustralia works constructively and closely with UNESCO and IUCN to protect the [Outstanding Universal Value](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/154/) of the Reef and all our World Heritage properties.\n\nThe Outstanding Universal Value of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area remains intact.\n\n- More about [Understanding World Heritage: what is outstanding universal value?](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/heritage/about/world-heritage/outstanding-universal-value)\n- More about [Managing World Heritage in Australia](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/heritage/about/world/management-australias-world-heritage-listed/managing-world-heritage-australia/monitoring-reporting)\n\n## Protecting the Great Barrier Reef\n\nAustralia is taking increased action to [protect the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/reef-2050-plan).\n\nThis is supported by a record investment, world-leading science and the efforts of vast network of Reef partners.\n\nOur actions are guided by the [Reef 2050 Plan](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/protecting/reef-2050-plan). This is the most comprehensive plan of corrective measures ever developed for a World Heritage property.\n\n## About the World Heritage Committee\n\nThe [World Heritage Committee](https://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/) is responsible for implementation of the World Heritage Convention and the final decision-maker on inscription of properties on the World Heritage List.\n\nThe Committee meets once a year to examine the State of Conservation of inscribed properties.\n\nWhere necessary, the Committee will ask State Parties to take action to ensure the Outstanding Universal Value of listed properties is not compromised.\n\n## World Heritage Committee decision on the Reef\n\nThe 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (46COM) was held 21-31 July 2024 in New Delhi, India.\n\nThe Committee adopted the draft decision from UNESCO released in June 2024.\n\nThe decision recognises the increased action Australia is taking to protect the Reef and that we are delivering on our commitments.\n\nIt requests Australia to report back to the Committee in 2025 with an update on progress on actions to protect and manage the Reef.\n\nIt also requests Australia to provide a state of conservation report by 1 February 2026.\n\nRead more about [UNESCO decisions, State Party Reports and other documents relating to the Reef](https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/8284).\n\n## World Heritage Reporting\n\nManaging the Reef includes monitoring the condition of its Outstanding Universal Value and reporting that information.\n\nAustralia has a long-standing record of regular public reporting on the Reef. This ensures we are transparent and accountable.\n\nIn the past five years Australia has provided:\n\n- two State Party Reports on the State of Conservation (December 2019, February 2022)\n- additional information ahead of 44COM (2021) and 45COM (2023)\n- hosted a joint Reactive Monitoring Mission (March 2022)\n- responded to the resulting report with new commitments (May 2023)\n- submitted the Great Barrier Reef Progress report (February 2024).\n\n### Progress report\n\nThe 46th session of the World Heritage Committee was held in July 2024.\n\nThe Committee agreed to adopt a draft decision proposed by UNESCO to not consider the Great Barrier Reef for the list of World Heritage in Danger.\n\nAs part of the Committee decision, Australia was requested to submit a progress report on the implementation of commitments made to the World Heritage Committee by 1 February 2025.\u00a0Australia submitted its progress report in January 2025.\n\nThe [2025 Great Barrier Reef Progress Report](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/publications/great-barrier-reef-progress-report-2025) provides an update on the implementation of commitments Australia made to UNESCO in May 2023.\n\nIt responds to the [2024 World Heritage Committee Decision on the Reef](https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/8588/).\n\n### State Party Report on the State of Conservation\n\nAustralia submitted an updated [State Party Report on the State of Conservation of the Great Barrier Reef](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/heritage/publications/state-party-report-gbr-2022) on 1 February 2022.\n\nThe report identified that the Outstanding Universal Value of the Reef remains intact.\n\nRead more about [State of Conservation reporting](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/node/13160#state-of-conservation-reporting).\n\n### Reactive Monitoring Mission\n\nTwo experts from UNESCO and the [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)](https://www.iucn.org/) attended a [Reactive Monitoring Mission](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/node/13160#reactive-monitoring) to the Reef from 21-30 March 2022.\n\nThis provided an opportunity to review the outstanding work of reef communities, reef managers, marine scientists, and First Nations people in protecting the Reef.\n\nThe [Report of the Reactive Monitoring Mission to the Great Barrier Reef](https://whc.unesco.org/document/197090) was released in May 2023. It provided a series of recommendations. These recommendations were based on an assessment of Australian management arrangements and policies that were in place in March 2022.\n\nThe report is one of many inputs that informed the World Heritage Committee\u2019s decision on the status of the Reef in September 2023.\n\nFollowing the release of the Report, Australia provided a set of commitments to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. The commitments focused on actions to address key threats for the Reef.\n\nRead the [Great Barrier Reef Progress Report - 2024](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/great-barrier-reef/publications/great-barrier-reef-progress-report) for details on these commitments.\n\nThe key issues including actions to advance reef protection from climate change, water quality and fisheries. Specific recommendations to address these issues include:\n\n- increased action to address the impact of climate change on the Reef\n- additional funding to support Reef water quality\n- a need for sustainable fisheries, improved data validation and addressing threats to protected species from fishing gear.\n\nThe report recognised the \u2018unparalleled science and management efforts\u2019 undertaken on the Great Barrier Reef. It also recognised the \u2018excellent and outstanding work\u2019 of numerous stakeholders in its management and conservation.\n\nRead more about [Managing World Heritage in Australia](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/parks-heritage/heritage/about/world/management-australias-world-heritage-listed/managing-world-heritage-australia/monitoring-reporting).\n\n## UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger\n\nUNESCO\u2019s [List of World Heritage in Danger](https://whc.unesco.org/en/158) is designed to inform the international community of conditions that threaten the characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List.\n\nIt is also designed to encourage corrective action and attract financial support.\n\nAustralia considers that placing the Great Barrier Reef on the List of World Heritage in Danger would not address or improve outcomes for the Reef.\n\nAustralia is doing more than ever to better manage and protect the Reef.\n\nAustralia\u2019s management of the Great Barrier Reef is world-class. This has been recognised by UNESCO and other countries. The level of investment directed at the Reef is unprecedented.\n\nThanks for your feedback.\n\nThanks!
