He is well known for co-authoring a 1999 study[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-4) with graduate student [Justin Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kruger) after reading about the [1995 Greater Pittsburgh bank robberies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Greater_Pittsburgh_bank_robberies) in which the perpetrators wore [lemon juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_juice) instead of masks, thinking it would make them invisible to [security cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_camera).[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-The_New_York_Times-6) This study showed that people who performed the lowest at certain tasks, such as judging humor, grammar, and logic, significantly overestimated how good they were at these tasks. This study has since given rise to what is known as the [Dunning\u2013Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) in which people mistakenly assess their [cognitive ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) as greater than it is.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-at-7) The study also found that people who performed slightly above average at identifying how funny a given joke was tended to be the most accurate at assessing how good they were at the assigned tasks, and that those who performed the best tended to think they performed only slightly above average.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-8) In 2012, Dunning told _[Ars Technica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica)_ that he \"thought the paper would never be published\" and that he was \"struck just with how long and how much this idea has gone viral in so many areas.\"[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-at-7)\n\n## Positions\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Dunning&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nDunning is the executive officer of the [Society for Personality and Social Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Personality_and_Social_Psychology) and the Foundation for Personality and Social Psychology. He has also served as an associate editor of the _[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology)_.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-cornell-2)\n\n## Awards\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Dunning&action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nIn 2021, Dunning was listed by Stanford University as being in the world's top 2% most cited psychological scientists.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-9)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-10)\n\n## References\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Dunning&action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\n01. ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_ref-umich_1-0) [_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_ref-umich_1-1)[\"David Dunning\"](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ddunning.html). _University of Michigan_.

In my social psychological work, I am interested in how, and when, people's perceptions of themselves and their surrounding differ from an objectively definable reality. In my psycholegal work, I concentrate on accuracy and error in eyewitness testimony.\nMy social psychological work focuses on two related phenomena concerning self and social judgment. First, I am interested in why people tend to have overly favorable and objectively indefensible views of their own abilities. For example, a full 94% of college professors say they do \"above average\" work, although it is impossible for nearly everyone to be above average. Second, I am interested in why people use themselves as the \"model of excellence\" in judgments of other people. For example, ask people what it takes to be an \"effective leader,\" and they tend to describe someone who resembles themselves. Task-oriented people (e.g., they describe themselves as persistent, ambitious) tend to cite task-skills as important in leadership. People-oriented individuals (e.g., they describe themselves as friendly and tactful) tend to emphasize social skills in their definition of the effective leader. In past work, I have found that the second phenomenon (using the self as model of excellence) produces the first phenomenon described above (too many people describe themselves as above average). I have also found that using the self as the model of excellence in judging others leads to many disagreements in social judgment. In current work, I am focusing on why people tend to define excellence so egocentrically. But, more importantly, I am looking for circumstances in which people will stop using themselves as the standard of judgment.\nMy work in eyewitness testimony is a search for something, anything that might help people to distinguish accurate eyewitnesses from erroneous ones. In recently published work, we focus on witnesses making identifications of a perpetrator from a line-up. We found that asking witnesses how they reached their identifications went a good way toward telling whether they had made an accurate ones. Accurate witnesses tended to have difficulty providing a description of how they had reached their decisions (e.g., \"I don't know why, I just recognized him.\"). Inaccurate witnesses tended to have long-winded explanations focusing on process of elimination (e.g., I compared the photos to each other in order to narrow the choices.\"). In more recent work, we are trying to extend this research by refining these measures, to find more valid and reliable measures of eyewitness accuracy and error.\n\n### Primary Interests:\n\n- Causal Attribution\n- Judgment and Decision Making\n- Law and Public Policy\n- Person Perception\n- Self and Identity\n\n### Research Group or Laboratory:\n\n- [Self and Social Insight Laboratory](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sasi/)\n - [Interactive Map](https://maps.google.com/?q=42.275657598731826,-83.73496055603027)\n\n**Note from the Network**: The holder of this profile has certified having all necessary rights, licenses, and authorization to post the files listed below.

As a young boy, Dunning was very energetic and active. At 12 years of age, he and a friend were \u201croughed up\u201d by guards after they ventured too close to the home of Alden B. Dow, a renowned American architect who was based in Midland.\n\nAs a child, Dunning\u2019s dream was to become a cartoonist and later, a screenwriter. At age 13, he submitted a script to Larry Gelbart, producer of the TV show \u201cMASH.\u201d Later, while attending Midland High School, Dunning approached Gene Roddenberry\u2014the creator of the original Star Trek television series\u2014and told him that he wanted to become a screenwriter. Roddenberry encouraged Dunning to \u201cwrite 1,000 words a day, everyday\u201d if he wanted to become a good writer. Dunning was also a big fan of Buck Henry, a former American actor, screenwriter, and director.\n\nDunning was very athletic during his youth and claims to have spent much of his early life \u201crunning up and down the left side of the \\[soccer\\] pitch.\u201d He also developed a love of music from an early age and says the first three albums he bought with his own money were Songs in the Key of Life (by Stevie Wonder), Hotel California (by the Eagles) and Aja (by American rock duo Steely Dan). Dunning became a big fan of Steely Dan and still recalls when one of their concerts was held outside his hometown in 1977.\n\n## **Educational Background**\n\nDunning obtained his B.A. in Psychology from Michigan State University in 1982 and his Ph.D in Psychology from Stanford University in 1986. He revealed that Michigan State taught him the importance of scientific rigor, while Stanford taught him the importance of incorporating humanity into his work.\n\nDunning had several mentors during his academic career, including Joel Aronoff and Larry Messe of Michigan State, and Lee Ross and Phoebe Ellsworth of Stanford. Dunning was also greatly influenced by the work of Amos Tversky, a former psychology professor at Stanford. He developed great respect for Tversky, and regarded him as a real-life example of \u201cwhat smart looks like.\u201d Dunning describes himself as a \u201cresearcher in the tradition of Amos Tversky and Daniel Khaneman,\u201d both of whom did significant work on the psychology of human judgment and decision-making.\n\nDunning is currently a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and professor emeritus of psychology at Cornell University. He has served as a visiting scholar at the University of Mannheim and the University of Cologne in Germany, as well as at Yale University.\n\n## **What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect?**\n\n**\u200b**\n\n![Dunning Kruker Effect](https://practicalpie.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)\n\n**The Dunning-Kruger effect is the name given to a cognitive bias in which people who perform poorly on a task overestimate their performance and abilities.** That is, they consider themselves to be more knowledgeable, skillful or competent than they really are. The phenomenon is named after David Dunning and fellow psychologist, Justin Kruger, both of whom documented the effect in a series of studies conducted at Cornell University in 1999.\n\nIn those studies, undergraduate psychology students were given tests designed to assess: (1) their ability to spot humor, (2) logical reasoning ability, and (3) grammar. They were then asked to rate how well they thought they had done on a percentile scale. The results? Students with the lowest scores grossly overestimated their abilities. For example, those who scored in the 12th percentile on one test rated themselves in the 62nd percentile. Although they had scored in the bottom quarter of the distribution, they believed their performance was above average.\n\n### **Why Does It Occur?**\n\nAccording to Dunning and Kruger, the lack of awareness among low scorers occured because the skills needed to perform well on a task are the same skills needed to evaluate how well that task had been performed. Put another way, if people lack the skills needed to answer a set of questions correctly, they also lack the skills needed to judge whether their or someone else\u2019s answers are correct. Low ability not only limits people\u2019s performance on a task; it also deprives them of the insight needed to accurately evaluate their performance. In the words of the researchers, it deprives them of the \u2018metacognitive skills\u2019 needed to accurately evaluate their competence. (Metacognitive skills allow us to evaluate ourselves\u2014to step back and think about our thoughts and other cognitive processes).\n\n### **Who Does It Affect?**\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect has been shown to be quite robust across several studies. It has been demonstrated among:\n\n- undergraduate students sitting an exam\n- medical students tasked with conducting interviews\n- medical laboratory technicians asked to evaluate their level of skill on the job\n- aviation students taking a pilot knowledge test\n- college students involved in a debate tournament\n\nAll humans are at risk of falling into the Dunning-Kruger trap since we all have areas in which we are incompetent. As such, we do not need to look far to find examples of the effect in everyday life. All of us have seen and heard people singing quite poorly, yet confidently, at local karaoke bars, on websites such as Youtube, and even on popular talent shows like America\u2019s Got Talent. To a neutral observer or judge, their performance might be absolutely horrendous, but in their own estimation, they are nothing short of amazing.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may seem, the Dunning-Kruger effect shows that in many cases, the less people know about something, the more they think their knowledge is adequate or even superior. Who of us has not had the unfortunate experience of speaking with someone who knows very little about a subject but believes he or she knows everything there is to know about it? It is just as Charles Darwin famously said, \u201cIgnorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.\u201d\n\n### **When Does It Occur?**\n\nThe findings of Dunning and Kruger\u2019s study should not be taken to mean that people who are incompetent in a given domain always overestimate their competence in that domain. Several other factors influence how likely they are to overestimate their performance, one of which is the actual domain in question. For example, people may have a tendency to overestimate their knowledge of politics or history, but very few would be under the illusion that they are as fast as Usain Bolt.\n\nIn areas such as politics and history, competence is based on knowledge\u2014a competent historian is one who knows a great deal about history. In such areas, it is easy for people to overestimate their competence since the knowledge needed to be a good historian is the same knowledge needed to judge how good of a historian one is. An incompetent historian would lack the knowledge needed to properly evaluate his (or someone else\u2019s) performance, setting the stage for the Dunning-Kruger effect to occur. In domains such as athletics where competence depends not just on knowledge but on actual physical skill, people are much less likely to develop a false sense of expertise.\n\nFor the Dunning-Kruger effect to occur, the researchers also noted that individuals must \u201csatisfy a minimum threshold of knowledge, theory or expertise that suggests to themselves that they can generate correct answers.\u201d The reason for this is clear. Hardly anyone (if anyone at all) would overestimate their ability to translate an article into Arabic when they have zero knowledge of that language. In other areas where individuals possess _some_ knowledge, however, there is a basis for overestimating their abilities.\n\n### **How Can It Be Overcome?**\n\nDunning and Kruger found that people\u2019s tendency to overestimate their performance can be overcome by increasing their competence. In one of their studies, when low performers on a test of logic received training in logical reasoning, they became better at evaluating their previous performance. The more people learn about a particular subject, the more they are able to recognize gaps in their knowledge and ability, and the more realistic their self-evaluations become.\n\nAside from seeking to increase one\u2019s level of competence, Dunning offers several other practical suggestions for avoiding or minimizing the Dunning-Kruger effect. He encourages individuals to:\n\n- Seek feedback on their performance from trusted individuals\n- Be mindful of when the effect is most likely to occur, for example, when learning something new\n- Avoid making quick, impulsive decisions\n- Take the time to consider ways in which they could be wrong or could be overlooking important information when making decisions\n\n## **What About Top Performers?**\n\nIn Dunning and Kruger\u2019s original study, the top performers had more accurate estimations of their performance than low performers. However, they tended to underestimate how well they had done. For example, although they achieved scores in the 89th percentile on one test, they rated themselves in the 70th percentile. The issue, according to Dunning and Kruger, is not that they believe they are less competent than they really are; they simply believe that other people are also very knowledgeable about the subject.\n\n### **Other Research Interests**\n\nIn addition to his above-mentioned work, Dunning has also conducted research in several other areas, including:\n\n**Social judgment**\\- In a study conducted with Andrew F. Hayes, Dunning set out to evaluate the role of the self in people\u2019s judgments of others. The results of the study suggest that people activate information about themselves and use their own behavior as a reference point when judging the traits and abilities of others. Dunning demonstrated these \u2018egocentric comparisons\u2019 in a series of studies conducted with some of his colleagues at Cornell University.\n\nIn one of those studies, participants were asked to describe the characteristics of an effective leader. Interestingly, the descriptions they gave were often reflections of themselves. Participants who were people-oriented placed an emphasis on social skills, while goal-oriented participants stressed task skills.\n\n**Motivated Reasoning** \\- Motivated reasoning refers to thought that is aimed at supporting a favored or predetermined conclusion. Dunning\u2019s interest in the subject relates primarily to how motivated reasoning influences thoughts about the self. As he notes in his writing, people are generally motivated to think well of themselves and to be optimistic about their futures. As a result, they actively distort, ignore, or accentuate existing evidence in order to reach pleasant conclusions about the self, as opposed to threatening ones.\n\nIn a series of studies with Emily Balcetis, Dunning found that motivated reasoning not only affects conscious thought, but also affects preconscious perceptual experience, such as vision. In one study, when participants were presented with ambiguous images that could be interpreted in one of two ways (e.g., as either a B or the number 13), they tended to see the image in the way that would result in more favorable outcomes for them.\n\n**Eyewitness testimony** \\- Dunning\u2019s work in this area involves identifying factors that can help distinguish between accurate and inaccurate eyewitness accounts. In a study conducted with Lisa Beth Stern, he focused on one particular aspect of eyewitness testimony, namely the identification of a perpetrator from a lineup. The researchers found that accurate witnesses could be distinguished from those who made inaccurate identifications by simply asking them about the decision-making processes that led to their judgments.\n\nAccurate witnesses had a hard time explaining exactly how they had arrived at their decision; their recognition of the perpetrator was automatic (e.g., \u201cI don't know why, I just recognized him,\u201d or \u201cHis face just \u201cpopped out at me.\u201d) In contrast, inaccurate witnesses provided much longer explanations based on a process of elimination (e.g., \u201cI compared the photos to each other in order to narrow the choices.\u201d) Accurate witnesses also arrived at their decisions more quickly than witnesses who were inaccurate.\n\n## **Applications of Dunning\u2019s Theories**\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect has been used to explain people\u2019s behavior in several domains, including education, politics, healthcare, and business. Knowing the conditions under which the effect is likely to occur, and being able to identify it when it does occur, can help individuals to lessen its impact.\n\nIn education, for example, teachers sometimes rely on students\u2019 evaluation of their own competence to determine the direction of lessons. If students claim to understand a particular topic, the teacher might promptly move on to the next topic for discussion. However, the Dunning-Kruger effect suggests that this might not be the best approach since students who have not mastered the lesson might overestimate their level of competence. A more objective means of assessing competence would therefore be more suitable.\n\nIn the workplace, employees are often asked to complete self-evaluations which may influence their eligibility for promotions and other benefits. In light of the Dunning-Kruger effect, managers would need to exercise caution when interpreting scores on these measures since less competent workers may overestimate their skills and abilities, while the most competent workers may underestimate theirs. It would be wise for employers to exercise similar caution when selecting job candidates based on their performance in interviews. The most confident candidates could actually be the least qualified for the job.\n\nIn both educational and work settings, the Dunning-Kruger effect also helps to explain why poor performers are often resistant to constructive feedback. Their lack of competence robs them of the skills needed to accurately assess their own performance, so they naturally conclude that the feedback is not justified. For example, a student with limited writing skills may complain about receiving an \u2018F\u2019 for an essay he believes is well-written but that is actually riddled with grammatical errors. Simply pointing out the errors might not be enough to make the student more accepting of the grade. The Dunning-Kruger effect suggests that in such a situation, additional training would be beneficial. As the student\u2019s knowledge of grammar improves, so would his ability to evaluate his own writing. He would then be able to see for himself why his original grade was merited. The same principle can be applied in the workplace.\n\n### **Criticisms of Dunning\u2019s Theories**\n\nAccording to Dunning and Kruger, incompetent people overestimate their performance and abilities because they lack the metacognitive skills needed to know that they are incompetent. Other theorists, however, have proposed alternative explanations for the original results. Two of the most common explanations are:\n\n1. **Regression to the mean** \\- Many critics contend that the Dunning-Kruger effect is merely a statistical phenomenon, a prime example of regression to the mean. Given that participants\u2019 actual test scores are imperfectly correlated with estimates of their performance, participants who obtain extreme scores on one variable will tend to have less extreme scores on the other variable. Low scorers will therefore tend to rate themselves as more competent than their test scores suggest, while high scorers will tend to rate themselves as less competent.\n\n1. **Self-enhancement motives** \\- Proponents of this explanation claim that most people have a tendency to view themselves in an overly positive light. This is sometimes referred to as the \u2018better-than-average heuristic\u2019 and is believed by some to account for people\u2019s inflated perceptions of their performance and abilities.\n\nIn Dunning and Kruger\u2019s original study, low scorers were the worst at estimating their performance, while top scorers were the most accurate. As previously explained, the researchers suggested that this pattern resulted from differences in metacognitive ability.\u00a0 However, other researchers have challenged this assumption. For example, Katherine A. Burson and her colleagues found that the difference in the accuracy of estimates between high and low scorers actually decreases, and even reverses, according to task difficulty.\n\nIn one study where students were asked _fairly_ difficult questions about their university, the top scorers were just as inaccurate in estimating their performance as were the low scorers. In a subsequent study, when participants were given _very_ difficult tasks, the low performers actually proved to be better at estimating their performance than the top performers.\n\nAccording to the researchers, when given fairly easy tasks (such as those in the original Dunning and Kruger study), most people assume they are pretty good compared to others. This explains why in the original study, low scorers significantly overestimated their performance, while top performers seemed to be more accurate. When the task is difficult, however, people tend to assume they performed poorly compared to others. Hence, in studies by Burson and her colleagues, low scorers seemed better at judging their performance while high scorers seemed worse.\n\nAccording to the researchers, these results show that people of low and high ability do not really differ in their ability to evaluate their performance as Dunning and Kruger suggest. Both groups have similar difficulty estimating how their performance compares to that of others. Whether high or low performers are better judges of their performance therefore depends more on task difficulty than on metacognitive skills.\n\n## **David Dunning's Books, Awards, and Accomplishments**\n\nDunning has published over 100 scholarly articles, book chapters, reviews and commentaries. He is the author of the book _Self-Insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself_ (2005), editor of the book _Social Motivation_ (2011), and co-editor of _The Self in Social Judgment_ (2005).\n\nDunning was a fellow of the American Psychological Society and the American Psychological Association. He also served as an associate editor of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Dunning was appointed as an Executive Officer for two organizations: the Society for Personality and Social Psychology and the Foundation for Personality and Social Psychology.\n\n### **Personal Life**\n\nDunning follows politics in the United States very closely and is a big fan of movies and music. His favorite movie is _The Insider_, starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. He also enjoys watching \u201cintellectual fantasy series like _Watchmen_ and _Westworld_.\u201d These days, his music interests are centered on Canadian and British pop music.\n\nDunning plays golf in his spare time but as he has become less physically active with age, he satisfies his passion for sports primarily by watching games on the television. He watches popular soccer tournaments such as the World Cup and the English Premier League regularly and is a passionate supporter of English soccer club Arsenal.\n\n#### **References**\n\nDavid Dunning.

An experimental social psychologist, Dr. Dunning is a fellow of both the American Psychological Society and the American Psychological Association. He has published over 135 scholarly journal articles, book chapters, and commentaries, and has been a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, Yale University, the University of Cologne (Germany), and the University of Mannheim (Germany). He has also served as an associate editor of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and as the Executive Officer of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Currently, he is President of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and the President-Elect of the Society for the Study of Motivation. He also serves on the Publication & Communication Board of the American Psychological Association.\n\nHis work focuses primarily on the accuracy with which people view themselves and their peers. In his most widely-cited research, he showed that people tend to hold flattering opinions of themselves and their decisions that cannot be justified from objective evidence, work that has been featured in numerous newspapers (e.g., New York Times), magazines (e.g., U.S. News & World Report ), radio (e.g., National Public Radio), and television (e.g., CBS Early Show). It has been the subject of a radio documentary by CBC Radio, as well as an essay by film director Errol Morris. It has even been mentioned in a Doonesbury cartoon.\n\nThis work on the self has been supported financially by the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Templeton Foundation. It was recently reviewed in his book Self-insight: Roadblocks and detours on the path to knowing thyself (2005, Psychology Press).\n\nHe has also published work on eyewitness identification, depression, motivated distortion in visual perception, stereotyping, and behavioral economics.\n\n**BA \u2013 Psychology** (1982) \u2013 Michigan State University\n\n**PhD \u2013 Psychology** (1986) \u2013 Stanford University\n\n**[Curriculum Vita](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sasi/wp-content/uploads/sites/275/2015/09/Dunning-Vita.docx)**\n\n[![lsa logo](https://courses.lsa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LSA-informal-white-1.png)](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa)[![um logo](https://courses.lsa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2color-transparentbg.png)](https://umich.edu)[U-M Privacy Statement](https://umich.edu/about/privacy/) [Accessibility at U-M](https://accessibility.umich.edu/)"

Low-ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence. The combination of poor[self-awareness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-awareness-2795023)and low cognitive ability leads them to overestimate their capabilities.\nThe basic idea behind the Dunning-Kruger effect is this: if you don&#39;t know something, you also don&#39;t have the ability to recognize that you don&#39;t know it.\nThe term lends a scientific name and explanation to a problem that many people immediately recognize\u2014that fools are blind to their own foolishness. As Charles Darwin wrote in his book*The Descent of Man*, &#34;Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.&#34;\nKeep reading to learn more about how the Dunning-Kruger effects works, the history of research on this phenomenon, and why people may overestimate their skills. Also, explore some of the ways you can avoid overestimating how much you really know about a subject.\n## Understanding the Dunning-Kruger Effect\nYou&#39;ve probably experienced this phenomenon in real life. An example of the Dunning-Kruger effect is a situation that many have perhaps experienced around the dinner table at a holiday family gathering.\nThroughout the meal, a member of your extended family spouts off on a topic at length, boldly\u00a0proclaiming that they are correct and that everyone else&#39;s opinion is stupid, uninformed, and just plain wrong. While it may be evident that this person has no idea what they are talking about, they prattle on, blithely oblivious to their ignorance.\nThe effect is named after researchers David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the two[social psychologists](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-social-psychologist-2795644)who first described it. In their original study, they performed four investigations into this psychological phenomenon.\nPeople who scored in the lowest percentiles on grammar, humor, and logic tests also tended to dramatically overestimate how well they had performed (their actual test scores placed them in the 12th percentile, but they estimated that their performance placed them in the 62nd percentile).\n### The Research\nIn one experiment, for example, Dunning and Kruger asked their 65 participants to rate how funny different jokes were. Some participants were exceptionally poor at determining what other people would find funny\u2014yet these subjects described themselves as excellent judges of[humor](https://www.verywellmind.com/health-benefits-of-humor-and-laughter-5101137).\nIncompetent people, the researchers suggested, were not only poor performers but were also unable to accurately assess and recognize the quality of their work. This is perhaps why students who earn failing scores on exams sometimes feel they deserve a much higher score. They overestimate their knowledge and ability and cannot accurately assess their performance.\nPeople who aren&#39;t good at something have a hard time recognizing other people&#39;s skill and competence levels. That&#39;s why they consistently view themselves as better, more capable, and more knowledgeable than others.\n&#34;In many cases, incompetence does not leave people disoriented, perplexed, or cautious,&#34; wrote David Dunning in an article for*Pacific Standard*. &#34;Instead, the incompetent are often blessed with an inappropriate confidence, buoyed by*something*that feels to them like knowledge.&#34;\n### How It Affects Behavior and Decisions\nTh Dunning-Kruger effect can have a profound impact on what people believe, the decisions they make, and the actions they take.\nIn one study, Dunning and Ehrlinger found that women performed equally to men on a science quiz\u2014yet women underestimated their performance because they believed they had less scientific reasoning ability than men. The researchers also found that these women were more likely to refuse to enter a science competition due to this belief.\nDunning and his colleagues have also performed experiments in which they asked respondents if they were familiar with various terms related to subjects such as politics, biology, physics, and geography. Along with genuine subject-relevant concepts, they interjected completely made-up terms.\nIn one such study, approximately 90% of respondents claimed they had at least some knowledge of the made-up terms. Consistent with other findings related to the Dunning-Kruger effect, the more familiar participants claimed that they were with a topic, the more likely they were also to claim they were familiar with the meaningless terms.\n## Why the Dunning-Kruger Effect Happens\nSo what explains this psychological effect? Are some people simply too dense to recognize their shortcomings? Dunning and Kruger suggest that this phenomenon stems from what they refer to as a &#34;dual burden.&#34; People are not only incompetent; their incompetence robs them of the mental ability to realize just how inept they are.\nIncompetent people tend to:\n* Overestimate their skill levels\n* Fail to recognize the genuine skill and expertise of other people\n* Fail to recognize their own mistakes and lack of skill\nThe very knowledge and skills necessary to be good at a task are the same qualities that a person needs to recognize that they are not good at that task. So if a person lacks those abilities, they remain not only bad at that task but ignorant of their inability.\nThis effect has been attributed to a number of different explanations, including:\n### An Inability to Recognize Lack of Skill and Mistakes\nDunning suggests that deficits in skill and expertise create a two-pronged problem. First, these deficits cause people to perform poorly in the domain in which they are incompetent. Secondly, their erroneous and deficient knowledge makes them unable to recognize their mistakes.\n### A Lack of Metacognition\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect is also related to difficulties with metacognition.\nMetacognition refers to the ability to step back and look at one&#39;s behavior and abilities from outside of oneself.\nPeople can often only evaluate themselves from their own limited and highly subjective point of view. From this limited perspective, they seem highly skilled, knowledgeable, and[superior](https://www.verywellmind.com/superiority-complex-causes-characteristics-and-coping-7095818)to others. Because of this, people sometimes struggle to have a more realistic view of their abilities.\n### A Little Knowledge Can Lead to Overconfidence\nAnother contributing factor is that sometimes a tiny bit of knowledge on a subject can lead people to mistakenly believe that they know all there is to know about it. As the old saying goes, a little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing.\nA person might have the slimmest bit of awareness about a subject, yet thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect, believe that they are an expert.\nThis is why people who say that they&#39;ve &#34;done their research&#34; arrive at erroneous and misinformed conclusions. Because they lack the requisite background knowledge and skill, they aren&#39;t able to recognize their own gaps in knowledge.\n### Other Factors That Play a Role\nOther factors that can contribute to the effect include:\n* The use of[heuristics](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-heuristic-2795235), or mental shortcuts that allow people to make decisions quickly\n* A tendency to[seek out patterns](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-11767616)even where none exist\nOur minds are primed to try to make sense of the disparate array of information we deal with daily. As we try to cut through the confusion and interpret our abilities and performance within our worlds, it is perhaps not surprising that we sometimes fail so completely to judge how well we do accurately.\n## Are You Less Competent Than You Think?\nSo, who is affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect? According to the researchers, everyone is prone to this effect. This is because no matter how informed or experienced we are, we all have our areas of ignorance. You might be smart and skilled in many areas, but no one is an expert at everything.\nEveryone is susceptible to this phenomenon, and most of us probably experience it with surprising regularity. Genuine experts in one area may mistakenly believe that their intelligence and knowledge carry over into other areas in which they are less familiar.\nA brilliant scientist, for example, might be a very poor writer. For the scientist to recognize their lack of skill, they need to possess a good working knowledge of grammar, composition, and other elements of writing. Because those are lacking, the scientist in this example cannot recognize their poor performance.\n### One Important Note\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect is not synonymous with[low IQ](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-are-scores-on-iq-tests-calculated-2795584). As awareness of the term has increased, its misapplication as a synonym for \"stupid\" has also grown. The fact is that it is something that affects all of us, no matter how smart we (think) we are. It is, after all, easy to judge others and believe that such things simply do not apply to us.\n### Is the Dunning-Kruger Effect Real?\nNot everyone agrees that the Dunning-Kruger effect actually exists, however. Instead, some critics have suggested that the effect is actually a data artifact. In mathematical studies, researchers were able to replicate the effect using computer-generated random data.\u00a0Such studies found that experts and amateurs overestimate or underestimate their abilities at about the same rate.\nHowever, the research found that experts tend to be better at assessing their abilities and that women generally make more accurate self-assessments than men.\nA 2022 study also suggested a statistical explanation for the effect that does not rely on a psychological explanation. According to the researchers, the effect exists, but it is not the result of human nature.\n### Dunning-Kruger Effect vs. Imposter Syndrome\nSo, if the incompetent tend to think they are experts, what do genuine experts think of their own abilities? Dunning and Kruger found that those at the high end of the competence spectrum did hold more realistic views of their own knowledge and capabilities. However, these experts actually tended to underestimate their own abilities relative to how others did.\nTop-scoring individuals know that they are better than the average, but they are not convinced of how superior their performance is to others. The problem, in this case, is not that experts don&#39;t know how well-informed they are; they tend to believe that everyone else is also knowledgeable.\nThis can sometimes lead to the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger effect\u2014[imposter syndrome](https://www.verywellmind.com/imposter-syndrome-and-social-anxiety-disorder-4156469). Since the Dunning-Kruger effect involves[overconfidence in one's abilities](https://www.verywellmind.com/overconfidence-bias-8707133), the opposing tendency would involve underconfidence in one's abilities. In imposter syndrome, competent people doubt their own abilities and fear that others will discover them to be frauds.\n## How to Overcome the Dunning-Kruger Effect\nIs there anything that can minimize this phenomenon? Is there a point at which the incompetent actually recognize their own ineptitude?\nAccording to Dunning, we are all what he calls &#34;engines of misbelief.&#34; While we are all prone to experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect, learning more about how the mind works and the mistakes we are all susceptible to might be one step toward correcting such patterns.\nAs people learn more about the topic of interest, they begin to recognize their lack of knowledge and ability. Then as people gain more information and become experts on a topic, their confidence levels begin to improve again.\nWhat can you do to gain a more realistic assessment of your abilities in a particular area if you are unsure you can trust your self-assessment?\n### Keep Learning and Practicing\nInstead of assuming you know all there is to know about a subject, keep digging deeper. Once you gain greater knowledge of a topic, you will likely recognize how much there is still to learn. This can combat the tendency to assume you\u2019re an expert, even if you&#39;re not.\n### Ask Other People How You&#39;re Doing\nAnother effective strategy involves asking others for[constructive criticism](https://www.verywellmind.com/turning-negative-feedback-into-positive-change-7964139). While it can sometimes be difficult to hear, such feedback can provide valuable insights into how others perceive your abilities.\n### Question What You Know\nEven as you learn more and get feedback, it can be easy to only pay attention to things that confirm what you think you already know. This is an example of another type of psychological bias known as the[confirmation bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-confirmation-bias-2795024).\nTo minimize this tendency, keep challenging your beliefs and expectations. Seek out information that challenges your ideas.\n[When Too Much Self-Confidence Is a Bad Thing](https://www.verywellmind.com/can-you-have-too-much-self-confidence-4163364)\nRead more:\n* [Psychology](https://www.verywellmind.com/psychology-4157187)\n* [Theories](https://www.verywellmind.com/theories-of-psychology-4157184)\n* [Cognitive Psychology](https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-psychology-overview-4581791)\n10 Sources\nVerywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

But in the superheated world of social media discourse, #DoYourOwnResearch is a spicy rejoinder that essentially challenges someone to Google the subject since they clearly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But Googling, social psychologist David Dunning pointedly notes, is not research. \u201cThe beauty and the terror of the internet,\u201d he tells interviewer David Edmonds in this Social Science Bites podcast, \u201cis that there\u2019s a lot of terrific information, but there\u2019s also a lot of misinformation and sometimes outright fraud.\n\n\u201cPeople often don\u2019t have the wherewithal to distinguish.\u201d\n\nThis distinguishing is an area where Dunning, a professor at the University of Michigan, does his own research.\n\nWhile doing your own internet sleuthing isn\u2019t toxic on its face, Dunning suggests that often \u201cyou don\u2019t know when you\u2019re researching your way into a false conclusion, and \u2026 you don\u2019t know when to stop. The real hard problem with DYOR is when do you know when to stop: you go and you look at a couple of web pages, and \u2018Well, you\u2019ve learned something! Terrific!\u2019 But you don\u2019t know how much there is behind it that you still need to learn.\u201d\n\n[Read the complete article in _Social Science Space_](https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2023/01/david-dunning-on-the-dunning-kruger-effect/)\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share) [Email](https://lsa.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#39065b565d4004514d4d494a031616554a58174c54505a51175c5d4c16494a405a5116575c4e4a145c4f5c574d4a1658555514575c4e4a165f585a4c554d4014575c4e4a165d584f505d145d4c575750575e145657144d515c145d4c575750575e14524b4c5e5c4b145c5f5f5c5a4d09)\n\n| Release Date: | 01/09/2023 |\n| Category: | [Faculty](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/news-events/all-news/faculty-news.html) |\n| Tags: | [David Dunning](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/news-events/all-news/search-news.html#page=1&q=&start=&end=&tag=lsa-people/D/ddunning&tagns=michigan-lsa) |\n\n[Department of Psychology](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych)\n\n[1004 East Hall\\\n530 Church Street\\\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109-1043](http://campusinfo.umich.edu/campusmap)\n\nEnrollment and Student Services:\n[\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lsa.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1767646e747f3964767657627a7e747f39727362) [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lsa.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2f5f5c564c47015f474b5f5d40485d4e426f5a42464c47014a4b5a)\nOther Department Administration:\n[\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lsa.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#daaaa9a3b9b2f4bbbeb7b3b49aafb7b3b9b2f4bfbeaf)\n\nClick to call 734.764.2580\n\n734.764.2580\n\n734.764.3520\n\n[Sitemap](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/sitemap.html)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UMichPsychology/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/um_psychology) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCniy_7E8pmQ-33Iu-Pes0Tw) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/86866125/)\n\n- Information For\n- [Prospective Students](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/prospective-students.html)\n- [Current Students](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/current-students.html)\n- [Faculty and Staff](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/faculty-staff.html)\n- [Alumni and Friends](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/alumni-friends.html)\n\n- More about LSA\n- [About LSA](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/about.html)\n- [How Do I Apply?](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/prospective-students/undergraduate/admissions.html)\n- [News](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/news-events/all-news.html)\n- [LSA Magazine](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/news-events/lsa-magazine.html)\n- [Give](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/support-lsa/give-to-the-college.html)\n- [Maps](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/about/maps.html)\n\n- Student Resources\n- [Courses](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/courses.html)\n- [Academic Advising](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/current-students/undergraduate-students/academic-advising.html)\n- [Majors and Minors](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/majors-minors.html)\n- [Departments and Units](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/departments-and-units.html)\n- [Global Studies](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/engaged-learning/global-studies.html)\n- [LSA Opportunity Hub](https://lsa.umich.edu/opportunityhub)\n\n- Connect\n- [Social Media](http://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/about/contact-us/social-media.html)\n- [Update Contact Info](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/alumni-friends/get-informed/contact-info-update.html)\n- [Contact Us](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/about/contact-us.html)\n- [Privacy Statement](https://umich.edu/about/privacy)\n- [Report Feedback](https://lsa.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n\n\u00a9 [2025 Regents of the University of Michigan](http://regents.umich.edu/)"

The annual $100,000 prizes were established in 1984 by industrialist and philanthropist H. Charles Grawemeyer to help make the world a better place.\n\n[Dunning](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ddunning.html) and [Kruger](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/justin-kruger#:~:text=Justin%20Kruger%20joined%20New%20York,Teaching%20Award%20for%20outstanding%20teaching.) are best known for describing the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOLmD_WVY-E&ab_channel=TED-Ed), which helps explain the human tendency to greatly overestimate their own knowledge or competence. Across various domains, they found it is often people who are the least skilled who are the most overconfident because they lack the skill needed to judge their own skills accurately.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect was first described in their 1999 study, \u201cUnskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One\u2019s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments.\u201d The paper was inspired by a news story about a bank robber who spread lemon juice over his face thinking it would make him invisible to security cameras.\n\nSince then, their finding has been cited in more than 8,500 scholarly publications and mentioned regularly in popular media discussions of issues ranging from national politics to education policy.\n\n\u201cThe research highlights the value of humility in our opinions and beliefs, particularly ones we hold about ourselves,\u201d Dunning said. \u201cSo it is quite easy just to be humbled by this award.\u201d\n\nLouisville psychologist Nicholaus Noles, the psychology award director for the Grawemeyer Awards, said \u201cthe Dunning-Kruger effect has always been an important finding, but the idea is likely to have even more impact in the years ahead as information and misinformation become more available to us and our society struggles with when and how to trust experts in a variety of domains.\u201d\n\nDunning is a professor of psychology and a faculty associate at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at U-M\u2019s Institute for Social Research. Kruger is a senior research scholar at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business.\n\nRecipients of Grawemeyer awards visit Louisville in the spring to accept their $100,000 prizes and give free talks about their ideas. Charles Grawemeyer established the award to underscore the impact that a single idea can have on the world.\n\n[![University of Michigan Logo](https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/themes/news2018/assets/umich-logo.png)](http://umich.edu/)\n\n412 Maynard St.\n\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109-1399\n\n[_Email_\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://news.umich.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#36435b5f555e5853414576435b5f555e18535243)\n\n[_Phone_ 734-764-7260](tel:7347647260)\n\n[About Michigan News](https://news.umich.edu/about/)\n\n##### More News\n\n- [Arts](http://arts.umich.edu/)\n- [Athletics](http://mgoblue.com/)\n- [Engaged Michigan](http://engaged.umich.edu/)\n- [Global Michigan](http://global.umich.edu/)\n- [Michigan Medicine](http://uofmhealth.org/)\n- [Public Affairs](http://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/)\n\n##### Publications\n\n- [Michigan Today](http://michigantoday.umich.edu/)\n- [The University Record](http://record.umich.edu/)\n\n[Office of the Vice President for Communications](http://vpcomm.umich.edu/)\n\n\u00a9 2025 The [Regents of the University of Michigan](http://regents.umich.edu/)"

He is noted for his work in [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology). He coined the term _[evolutionary epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_epistemology)_ and developed a selectionist theory of human [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity). A _[Review of General Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_General_Psychology)_ survey, published in 2002, ranked Campbell as the 33rd most cited [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist) of the 20th century.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)\n\n## Biography\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nCampbell was born in 1916, and completed his undergraduate education in psychology at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley), where he and his younger sister, Fayette, graduated first and second, respectively, in the class of 1939.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), he earned his doctorate in psychology in 1947 from the University of California, Berkeley. He subsequently served on the faculties at [Ohio State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University), the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago), [Northwestern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University), [Syracuse University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University), and [Lehigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehigh_University).\n\nHe taught at Lehigh University, which established the Donald T. Campbell Social Science Research Prizes. Prior to that, he was on the faculty of the [Maxwell School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_School_of_Citizenship_and_Public_Affairs) of [Syracuse University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University), 1979\u20131982, and Northwestern University from 1953 to 1979. He gave the [William James Lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James_Lectures) at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University) in 1977. In June 1981, working with [Alexander Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rosenberg), Campbell organized an international conference held at Cazanovia, New York, to formulate the program of what he called an \"Epistemologically Relevant Sociology of Science\" (ERRES). By Campbell's own account, this project was at least premature.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)\n\nCampbell was elected to the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences) and the [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences) in 1973.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-4) In 1975, Campbell served as president of the [American Psychological Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association). He was elected to the [American Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society) in 1993.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-5)\n\nAmong his other honors, he received the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Contribution award, the Distinguished Contribution to Research in Education award from the [American Educational Research Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Educational_Research_Association), and honorary degrees from the Universities of [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan), [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida), Chicago, and [Southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California).\n\n## Work\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nCampbell made contributions in a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology), [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).\n\n### Multitrait-multimethod matrix\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nCampbell argued that the sophisticated use of many approaches, each with its own distinct but measurable flaws, was required to design reliable research projects and to ensure [convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_validity) and [discriminant validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity). The paper he wrote with [Donald W. Fiske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_W._Fiske) to present this thesis, \"Convergent and Discriminant Validation by the [Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrait-multimethod_matrix)\",[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-6) is one of the most frequently cited papers in the social science literature.\n\n### Blind variation and selective retention\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\nBlind variation and selective retention (BVSR) is a phrase introduced by Campbell to describe the most fundamental principle underlying [cultural evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_evolution).[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-7) In [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), it is seen as a principle for describing change in evolutionary systems in general, not just in biological organisms. For example, it can also be applied to scientific discovery, [memetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) evolution, or [genetic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming). As such, it forms a foundation for what has later been called [universal Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism).\n\n### Evolutionary epistemology\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=5)\\]\n\nApplying the BVSR principle to the evolution of knowledge, Campbell founded the domain of [evolutionary epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_epistemology).[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-8) This can be seen as a generalization of [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper)'s [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science), which conceives the development of new theories as a process of proposing conjectures (blind variation) followed by the refutation (selective elimination) of those conjectures that are empirically [falsified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). Campbell added that the same logic of blind variation and selective elimination/retention underlies all knowledge processes, not only scientific ones. Thus, the BVSR mechanism explains not only creativity, but also the evolution of [instinctive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct) knowledge, and of our [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) abilities in general.\n\n### \"The Experimenting Society\"\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=6)\\]\n\nCampbell also had a vision for how [public policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy) could be improved through the use of experimentation. He argued for a more collaborative method of public policy that involved various stakeholders and that used experimentation and data as a guide for decision making. The vision of this was laid out in his essay, \"The Experimenting Society\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-9)\n\nHis research and book _Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research_ became the standard in policy-evaluation circles. Campbell did not start out intending to be a program evaluator, but his devotion to understanding [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), human behavior, and how to solve social questions led him there.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-10)\n\n### \"Ethnocentrism of Disciplines and the Fish-Scale Model of Omniscience\"\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=7)\\]\n\nCampbell wrote an article in 1969 arguing that an obstacle to a \"comprehensive, integrated multiscience\" was that different areas of the [behavioral sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences) were clustered together and separated from other areas. That is, there was \"a redundant piling up of highly similar specialties leaving interdisciplinary gaps\". He wrote that often the approach taken to dealing with these gaps was to encourage multidisciplinary scholars, meaning those who are knowledgeable and competent in multiple areas, but that this was ill-guided because the level of knowledge that makes for good scholars requires specialisation. In his view, a wiser approach would be \"invent\\[ing\\] alternative social organizations that will permit the flourishing of narrow interdisciplinary specialties.\" These interdisciplinary specialties would then fill in the gaps between disciplines.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-11)\n\n## Further development of Campbell's ideas\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=8)\\]\n\nIn the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of \"blind-variation-and-selective-retention\" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of \"universal selection theory\"[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-12) or \"universal selectionism\"[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-13) by [Gary Cziko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cziko),[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-15) Mark Bickhard,[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-16) and [Francis Heylighen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Heylighen).[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-17)[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-18)\n\nIn 2000, a group of 85 social and behavioural scientists and social practitioners from 13 countries met in Philadelphia, USA and founded the [Campbell Collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Collaboration). The collaboration aims to address the need for an organisation that produces systematic reviews of research evidence on the effectiveness of social interventions. Many of the people involved in the establishment of the Campbell Collaboration were from [Cochrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_(organisation)).[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-19)\n\n## Selected works\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_T._Campbell&action=edit&section=9)\\]\n\n- 1959, with Donald W.

How\u0002ever, people tend to be blissfully\nunaware of their incompetence.\nThis lack of awareness arises be\u0002cause poor performers are dou\u0002bly cursed: Their lack of skill\ndeprives them not only of the\nability to produce correct re\u0002sponses, but also of the expertise\nnecessary to surmise that they\nare not producing them. People\nbase their perceptions of perfor\u0002mance, in part, on their precon\u0002ceived notions about their skills.\nBecause these notions often do\nnot correlate with objective per\u0002formance, they can lead people\nto make judgments about their\nperformance that have little to\ndo with actual accomplishment.\nKeywords\nself-evaluation; metacognition;\nself-concept; overconfidence;\nperformance evaluation\nReal knowledge is to know the extent\nof one\u2019s ignorance.\n\u2014Confucius\nConfucius\u2019 observation rings\njust as true today as it did 26 centu\u0002ries ago. To achieve and maintain\nan adequate measure of the good\nlife, people must have some insight\ninto their limitations. To ace an\nexam, a college student must know\nwhen he needs to crack open his\nnotebook one more time. To provide\nadequate care, a physician must\nknow where her expertise ends and\nthe need to call in a specialist begins.\nRecent research we have con\u0002ducted, however, suggests that peo\u0002ple are not adept at spotting the lim\u0002its of their knowledge and expertise.\nIndeed, in many social and intellec\u0002tual domains, people are unaware of\ntheir incompetence, innocent of their\nignorance. Where they lack skill or\nknowledge, they greatly overesti\u0002mate their expertise and talent, think\u0002ing they are doing just fine when, in\nfact, they are doing quite poorly.\nIGNORANCE OF \nINCOMPETENCE: \nAN EXAMPLE\nConsider the following example.\nIn a sophomore-level psychology\n84 VOLUME 12, NUMBER 3, JUNE 2003\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Inc.\nclass, we asked 141 students to tell\nus how well they had done on an\nexam, just before they walked out\nof the classroom. We asked the re\u0002spondents to estimate their perfor\u0002mance and mastery of the course ma\u0002terial relative to the other students\ntaking the exam. We also asked\nthem to estimate their raw score on\nthe test.\nFigure 1 presents the data from\nthe comparison questions. In the\nfigure, we have separated respon\u0002dents into four groups based on\ntheir actual performance on the test,\nfrom the bottom 25% of performers\nto the top 25%. As the figure shows,\nstudents in the bottom quartile\ngreatly overestimated their perfor\u0002mance on the test. Whereas their\nperformance actually put them in\nthe 12th percentile, they estimated\ntheir mastery of the course mate\u0002rial to fall in the 60th percentile\nand their test performance to fall\nin the 57th. Figure 2 reveals a sim\u0002ilar pattern in estimates of raw\nscores, with bottom performers\noverestimating their performance\nby roughly 30%.\nThis example is not an isolated\ncase. Participants taking tests in\ntheir ability to think logically, to\nwrite grammatically, and to spot\nfunny jokes tend to overestimate\ntheir percentile ranking relative to\ntheir peers by some 40 to 50 points,\nthinking they are outperforming a\nmajority of their peers when, in\nfact, they are the ones being outper\u0002formed (Kruger & Dunning, 1999).\nThis pattern also emerges in more\nreal-world settings: among debate\nteams taking part in a college tour\u0002nament and hunters quizzed about\ntheir knowledge of firearms just be\u0002fore the start of hunting season\n(Ehrlinger, Johnson, Banner, Dun\u0002ning, & Kruger, 2003); among med\u0002ical residents evaluating their pa\u0002tient-interviewing skills (Hodges,\nRegehr, & Martin, 2001); and\namong medical lab technicians as\u0002sessing their knowledge of medical\nterminology and everyday problem\u0002solving ability in the lab (Haun,\nZeringue, Leach, & Foley, 2000).\nThis pattern even appears, un\u0002checked, after participants are prom\u0002ised up to $100 for accurate as\u0002sessments of their performance\n(Ehrlinger et al., 2003).\nTHE DOUBLE CURSE\nPeople fail to recognize their\nown incompetence because that in\u0002competence carries with it a double\ncurse. In many intellectual and so\u0002Fig. 1. Perceived percentile rankings for mastery of course material and test perfor\u0002mance as a function of actual performance rank.\nFig. 2. Perceived versus actual test score as a function of actual test performance.\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 American Psychological Society\nCURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 85\ncial domains, the skills needed to\nproduce correct responses are vir\u0002tually identical to those needed to\nevaluate the accuracy of one\u2019s re\u0002sponses. The skills needed to pro\u0002duce logically sound arguments, for\ninstance, are the same skills that\nare necessary to recognize when a\nlogically sound argument has been\nmade. Thus, if people lack the\nskills to produce correct answers,\nthey are also cursed with an inabil\u0002ity to know when their answers, or\nanyone else\u2019s, are right or wrong.\nThey cannot recognize their re\u0002sponses as mistaken, or other peo\u0002ple\u2019s responses as superior to their\nown. In short, incompetence means\nthat people cannot successfully\ncomplete the task of metacogni\u0002tion, which, among its many mean\u0002ings, refers to the ability to evalu\u0002ate responses as correct or incorrect.\nA good deal of research demon\u0002strates that poor performers have\nmore difficulty with metacognitive\njudgments than their more compe\u0002tent peers do. Relative to students\nwho are doing well, students doing\npoorly on a college exam do not as\nsuccessfully distinguish which in\u0002dividual questions they are getting\nright from which they are getting\nwrong (Sinkavich, 1995). Poor read\u0002ers are less accurate than more able\nreaders in judging what they com\u0002prehend from a passage of text\n(Maki & Berry, 1984). In our own\nresearch, students unskilled in\ngrammar provided less accurate\n\u201cgrades\u201d of the grammatical perfor\u0002mances of others than did their\nmore skilled counterparts (Kruger\n& Dunning, 1999, Study 3).\nThis double-curse explanation\nalso suggests a crucial hypothesis: If\npoor performers are given the\nskills necessary to distinguish cor\u0002rect from incorrect answers, then\nthey would be in a position to rec\u0002ognize their own incompetence. Of\ncourse, this hypothesis comes with\na paradox: If poor performers had\nthe skills needed to distinguish ac\u0002curacy from error, they would then\nhave the skills needed to avoid poor\nperformance in the first place. They\nwould no longer be incompetent.\nDespite this paradox, we de\u0002cided to put this hypothesis to the\ntest (Kruger & Dunning, 1999,\nStudy 4). In a first phase of the\nstudy, participants were tested on\ntheir ability to solve a certain type\nof logic problem. Not surprisingly,\npoor performers grossly overesti\u0002mated their performance on the\ntest. Then, in a second phase, we\ngave roughly half of the partici\u0002pants a mini-lecture about how to\nsolve this type of logic problem,\ngiving them the skills needed to\ndistinguish accurate from inaccu\u0002rate answers. When given their\noriginal test to look over, the par\u0002ticipants who received the lecture,\nand particularly those who were\npoor performers, provided much\nmore accurate self-ratings than\nthey had originally. They judged\ntheir performance quite harshly\u2014\nand even lowered their confidence\nin their own general logical reason\u0002ing ability, even though, if any\u0002thing, the mini-lecture had strength\u0002ened that ability, not weakened it.\nTHE UNDUE MODESTY OF \nTOP PERFORMERS\nTop performers also suffer a\nburden, albeit one that differs from\nthat of their less skilled counter\u0002parts in that they tend to underesti\u0002mate their percentile rank relative\nto the people with whom they\ncompare themselves. Their under\u0002estimation is usually statistically sig\u0002nificant (Ehrlinger et al., 2003; Haun\net al., 2000; Hodges et al., 2001;\nKruger & Dunning, 1999), al\u0002though in the case of Figure 1 it ap\u0002pears quite small.\nThis underestimation has a dif\u0002ferent source than the overestima\u0002tion of poor performers. Top per\u0002formers tend to have a relatively\ngood sense of how well they per\u0002form in absolute terms, such as\ntheir raw score on a test (see Fig. 2).\nWhere they err is in their estimates\nof other people\u2014consistently over\u0002estimating how well other people\nare doing on the same test (Fussell\n& Krauss, 1992). As a result, they\ntend to underestimate how their\nperformance compares with that of\nothers. One can disabuse top per\u0002formers of this misperception by\nshowing them the responses of\nother people. They then tend to re\u0002alize how unique and distinctive\ntheir performances are, providing\nmore positive and accurate self-eval\u0002uations. For example, asking people\nwho are particularly proficient in\ngrammar to evaluate the grammar\nof others causes them to appropri\u0002ately raise their perceptions of their\nown relative grammar skill. This\nexercise has no effect on the self\u0002impressions of poor performers\n(Kruger & Dunning, 1999, Study 3;\nsee also Hodges et al., 2001, for sim\u0002ilar findings involving interviewing\nskills among medical residents).2\nWHERE PERCEPTIONS OF \nCOMPETENCE COME FROM\nThe work we have summarized\nleaves open an important mystery.\nIt explains what does not happen\n(i.e., people recognizing their in\u0002competence), but it does not explain\nwhat does. How do people arrive at\nthe impressions, sometimes nega\u0002tive but usually positive, that they\nhold of their performances?\nIn recent research, we have\nidentified one important source of\npeople\u2019s performance evaluations,\nand shown that it can be a potential\nsource of error in those evalua\u0002tions. At first blush, one might\nthink that people judge how well\nthey are doing on a test by moni\u0002toring their experience with it. Are\nthey taking a long time to provide\n86 VOLUME 12, NUMBER 3, JUNE 2003\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Inc.\nthe answers? Are they sure there\nare no competitors to the answers\nthey give? Such an approach would\nbe termed bottom-up, as it refers to\nthe specific experiences people\nhave with the test.\nHowever, we have found that\npeople\u2019s estimates of their perfor\u0002mance arise, at least in part, from a\ntop-down approach. People start\nwith their preconceived beliefs\nabout their skill (e.g., \u201cI am good at\nlogical reasoning\u201d) and use those\nbeliefs to estimate how well they\nare doing on any specific test. This\nstrategy at first seems to be a good\none\u2014people who believe they\nhave logical reasoning skill should\nhave some basis for that claim\u2014ex\u0002cept for one fly in the ointment.\nPeople\u2019s impressions of their intel\u0002lectual and social skills often corre\u0002late only modestly, and sometimes\nnot at all, with measures of their\nactual performance (Falchikov &\nBoud, 1989). Indeed, and perhaps\nmore important, people just tend\nto hold overinflated views of their\nskills that cannot be justified by\ntheir objective performance (Dun\u0002ning, Meyerowitz, & Holzberg,\n1989; Weinstein, 1980). Therefore,\npreconceived notions of skill can\nlead people to err in their perfor\u0002mance estimates.\nIn several studies, we have shown\nthat people tend to make top-down\nperformance estimates that have\nlittle to do with objective perfor\u0002mance. In one study, we measured\nparticipants\u2019 views of their \u201cab\u0002stract reasoning ability\u201d before\nthey sat down and took a quiz on\nlogic. Later, their estimates of how\nwell they had done on the test (e.g.,\nhow many items they got right)\ncorrelated just as highly with their\npreexisting self-views as with their\nactual performance. In another\nstudy, we gave participants a test\nthat was purported to assess abstract\nreasoning ability (on which partici\u0002pants rated themselves highly) or\ncomputer programming skills (on\nwhich participants rated them\u0002selves quite negatively). Although\nparticipants in the two conditions\ntook the same test, and achieved on\naverage essentially the same score,\nthose who thought they had taken\nan abstract reasoning test estimated\nthat they had achieved higher scores\nthan did those who thought they had\ntaken a computer programming test\n(Ehrlinger & Dunning, 2003).\nThe top-down nature of perfor\u0002mance estimates can have important\nbehavioral consequences. Women,\nfor example, tend to disproportion\u0002ately leave science careers along\nevery step of the educational and\nprofessional ladder (Seymour,\n1992). We began to wonder if top\u0002down influences on performance es\u0002timates might contribute to this pat\u0002tern. Starting in adolescence, women\ntend to rate themselves as less scien\u0002tifically talented than men rate\nthemselves (Eccles, 1987). Because\nof this, women might start to think\nthey are doing less well on specific\nscientific tasks than men tend to\nthink, even when there is no gender\ndifference in performance. Thinking\nthey are doing less well, women\nmight become less enthusiastic about\nparticipating in scientific activities.\nWe put these notions to a test by\ngiving male and female college stu\u0002dents a pop quiz on scientific rea\u0002soning. Before the quiz, the students\nwere asked to rate themselves on\ntheir scientific skills, and the women\nrated themselves more negatively\nthan the men did. The students\u2019 es\u0002timates of their performance on the\nquiz showed the same pattern, with\nthe women thinking that they had\ndone less well than the men thought,\neven though there was no gender\ndifference in actual performance.\nLater, when asked if they would\nlike to participate in a science compe\u0002tition for fun and prizes, the women\nwere more likely than the men to de\u0002cline the invitation. This reluctance\ncorrelated significantly with their\nperceptions of performance on the\nquiz, but not at all with actual perfor\u0002mance (Ehrlinger & Dunning, 2003,\nStudy 4). Perception of performance,\nnot reality, influenced decisions\nabout future activities.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis research, combined with pre\u0002vious work (for a review, see Fal\u0002chikov & Boud, 1989), calls into\nquestion the ability people have to\nform accurate views of their skills\nand expertise. But more than that,\nit calls into question whether peo\u0002ple are, or ever can be, in a position\nto form accurate self-impressions.\nIf incompetent individuals do not\nhave the skills necessary to achieve\ninsight into their plight, how can\nthey be expected to achieve accu\u0002rate self-views? How can anybody\nbe sure that he or she is not in the\nsame position?\nThis research also potentially ex\u0002plains, in part, a mystery that peo\u0002ple regularly confront in their ev\u0002eryday dealings. Everyone knows\npeople who just seem to accept their\ndeficiencies, failing to work to im\u0002prove upon them. Perhaps these in\u0002dividuals \u201caccept\u201d their deficiencies\nbecause they are unaware that they\nhave them. As Alfred North White\u0002head once observed, it is not igno\u0002rance, but ignorance of ignorance,\nthat is the death of knowledge.\nOur work suggests many differ\u0002ent avenues of follow-up, but one\nparticularly important future ave\u0002nue would focus on how, or whether,\npeople can become aware of their in\u0002tellectual and social deficiencies.\nWhat are the domains in which peo\u0002ple naturally intuit their deficits, and\nhow do those domains differ from\nthe ones we have studied? Are there\nrules of thumb that people can fol\u0002low to ferret out their areas of in\u0002competence? Can people ever be\nexpected to uncover their pockets\nof incompetence on their own, or\nis outside intervention always nec\u0002essary?

In other analyses, we have ruled\nout another explanation for our find\u0002ings. It is almost a given that our mea\u0002sures of objective performance were\nimperfect, and that any measurement\nflaw would lead perceptions of perfor\u0002mance to correlate less than perfectly\nwith objective performance. This im\u0002perfect correlation would then cause\nthe perceptions of poor performers to\nbe more positive than their objective per\u0002formance (see Krueger & Mueller, 2002).\nHowever, across several studies, we\nhave found that statistically estimating\nand then correcting for imperfections\nin our measures leaves our original pat\u0002tern of misperception almost wholly in\u0002tact (Ehrlinger et al., 2003; Kruger &\nDunning, 2002).\nReferences\nDunning, D., Meyerowitz, J.A., & Holzberg, A.D.\n(1989).
