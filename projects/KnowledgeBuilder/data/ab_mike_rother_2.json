Your best bet is to practice\na universal means of developing your own solutions (a \u201cmeta skill\u201d for any situation).\nThat\u2019s what you learn by practicing the Improvement Kata.\nWhen conditions are complex and dynamic, scientific thinking may be the best\napproach we have for navigating. Scientific thinking means knowing that any idea\nshould be tested. It means learning to compare what you think (theory) with what\nactually happens (evidence), and adjusting based on what you discover from the\ndifference. It\u2019s a way of thinking that makes us better at reaching difficult goals\nthrough unpredictable territory.\nHowever, scientific thinking is not our natural, default\nmode. What normally happens is that our brain\nquickly and unconsciously jumps to conclusions.\nScientific thinking is not difficult, it\u2019s just not our habit.\nAdults learn scientific thinking through practice. There are simple \u201cStarter Kata\u201d practice\nroutines for each step of the Improvement Kata, and for coaching, whichspeed up your\nlearning and make it easier to scale in teams and organizations. The Improvement Kata\nmodels a pattern of practical, everyday scientific thinking, and the\nStarter Kata are what you practice to develop the thinking.\nInstructions for the Starter Kata are inthe[Toyota Kata Practice Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Practice-Guide-Practicing/dp/1264983816).\n![](The_Improvement_Kata_files/TOK.jpg)\n[Next:\u00a0 2.

But deeper study of Toyota showed us that its visible tools and practices are built on an invisible, scientific way of thinking. At Toyota you set challenging goals and experiment your way toward them\u2014adding to knowledge as you take steps\u2014instead of trying to decide your way to them.\nThat\u2019s a way of thinking and acting you have to learn, because it does not come naturally to humans. The default way we think about problems often involves jumping to conclusions\u2014not scientific thinking\u2014because the brain doesn\u2019t like uncertainty. The unconscious part of our brain takes bits of surface information, quickly extrapolates to fill in blanks, and gives us a false sense of confidence. And then we start making costly mistakes. However\u2026 we do have the power to change our thinking.\n**Deliberate Practice to Change Habits**\nChanging mindset involves weaving new neural pathways, by practicing a new way, which over time replace old pathways. Want to lose weight? Practice new patterns of eating and exercise. This raises the bar on educating ourselves to think more scientifically, since books, seminars or workshops alone probably won\u2019t change our habits. There are many practice guides for learning how to play music, cook, paint, play a sport, play chess, and countless other pursuits, yet surprisingly few for the useful skill of scientific thinking. Toyota Kata aims to change this.\n**Some Ingredients**\nWe have a pretty good idea of what does work for changing habits of mind\u2014daily practice sessions of some new routines, in the real workplace, with corrective feedback from a coach. Every time you think or do something you\u2019re more likely to do it again. First, we\u2019ll need some model of scientific thinking, in components or steps that can be taught one by one. Second, there should be a coach who can provide corrective feedback to the learner, so the learner practices and internalizes the right new patterns. Finally, we need some specific routines to practice, especially for beginners. These ingredients are exactly what the Toyota Kata Practice Guide provides.\nThe Improvement Kata is a four-step scientific pattern that learners follow to experiment their way through obstacles and achieve tough goals. The Coaching Kata is a pattern for teaching the Improvement Kata. It helps coaches practice sensing how the learner is thinking and giving effective feedback, in daily interactions called \u201ccoaching cycles.\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more. There are small, specific practice routines\u2014called Starter Kata\u2014 for each step of the Improvement Kata. This is where beginners start and is an entryway to developing new skills and changing your mindset.\n**Starter Kata Help Us Build New Habits**\nPracticing Kata has been utilized for centuries as a way of preserving effective skillsets, transmitting them from person to person, and building effective teamwork. The goal is to master each Starter Kata\u2019s fundamental pattern so you can then build on and adapt it in a variety of contexts as a reflex, with little thought or hesitation. Starter Kata are like a beginner musician practicing a musical scale. That\u2019s their role. You don\u2019t stick with playing a musical scale forever, you build on what you learned from practicing it. And the next learner who comes along then begins with the same Starter Kata. This is particularly useful if you want to build a shared way of thinking and acting\u2014a deliberate culture\u2014in a team or organization, because everyone begins with the same basics and develops a common language. Ultimately, though, Kata are not the important thing. What is important are the scientific skills and mindset that practicing them imparts, which you and your organization can use to strive for your particular goals, again and again. A good approach for the dynamic, unpredictable 21st\nCentury!\n* * *\n[Previous Post](https://nwirc.org/road-trip-to-targeted-pet-treats/) [Next Post](https://nwirc.org/nwircs-molly-reichard-is-certified-working-genius-facilitator/)"

The book explains the Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata, which are a means for making the [continual improvement process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) as observed at the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) teachable.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1)\n\n## Overview\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toyota_Kata&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n_Toyota Kata_ defines _management_ as, \u201cthe systematic pursuit of desired conditions by utilizing human capabilities in a concerted way.\u201d[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Rother2009-2):\u200a15\u200a Rother proposes that it is not solutions themselves that provide sustained competitive advantage and long-term survival, but the degree to which an organization has mastered an effective routine for developing fitting solutions again and again, along unpredictable paths. This requires teaching the skills behind the solution.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-3)\n\nIn this management approach a primary job of leaders and managers is to develop people so that desired results can be achieved. They do this by having the organization members (leaders and managers included) deliberately practice a routine, or [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata), that develops and channels their creative abilities. _Kata_ are patterns that are practiced so they become second nature, and were originally movement sequences in martial arts.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Rother2009-2):\u200a15\u200a[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-4)\n\nTwo major components of a kata are a **Coaching Kata** and an **Improvement Kata.** The Coaching Kata helps to develop skill in supporting learners \u2014 as the learner practices an Improvement Kata. Without coaching, a learner may not practice correctly or ineffectively, and a change is less likely. But because coaching itself is a skill that requires practice, the Coaching Kata helps to develop the skills to support a learner practicing an Improvement Kata. In other word, the Coaching Kata is practiced by managers, supervisors and team leaders who want to coach their learners in a scientific way of thinking and acting.\n\n## The Improvement Kata\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toyota_Kata&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nThe Improvement Kata is a routine for moving from the current situation to a new situation in a creative, directed, meaningful way. It is based on a four-part model:\n\n1. In consideration of a vision or direction...\n2. Grasp the current condition.\n3. Define the next target condition.\n4. Move toward that target condition iteratively, which uncovers obstacles that need to be worked on.\n\nIn contrast to approaches that attempt to predict the path and focus on implementation, the Improvement Kata builds on discovery that occurs along the way. Teams using the Improvement Kata learn as they strive to reach a target condition, and adapt based on what they are learning.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-5)\n\n_Toyota Kata_ submits that the Improvement Kata pattern of thinking and behavior is universal; applicable not only in business but in education, politics, daily living, etc.. The book's underlying message is that when people practice and learn a kata for how to proceed through unclear territory, they don't need to fear the obstacles, changes and unknowns they encounter. Rather than trying to hold on to a sense of certainty based on one's perspective, people can derive confidence from a kata for working through uncertainty.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Rother2009-2):\u200a18\n\nThe notion of Improvement Kata as a process of continuous improvement contributed also to the formation of the DevOps movement.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-6)\n\n## The Coaching Kata\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toyota_Kata&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nThe Coaching Kata is a routine used to teach the improvement kata and requires prior experience with practicing the Improvement Kata.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Rother2009-2):\u200a171\u200a The teaching approach embodied in the improvement kata within the [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) model emphasizes a continuous, respectful mentor-mentee relationship. This method is centered around several key principles:[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-7)\n\n1. Ongoing Coaching Necessity\n2. Foundation of Respect and TrustUniversal Coaching System\n3. High Skill Standards for Coaches\n4. Importance of A3 Thinking\n5. Role of the Coach\n6. Self-Directed Solution Finding\n7. Accountability of Results\n\nThis method showcases a patient, respectful, and immersive learning culture, where [continuous improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) is not just a goal but a journey of collaborative growth and shared responsibility.\n\n## References\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toyota_Kata&action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\n1. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_ref-1)**[\"Centre for Industrial services\"](https://cis.tennessee.edu/consulting/Pages/KATA.aspx).

Mike Rother explains why typical companies fail to understand the core of lean and make limited progress\u2014and what it takes to make it a real part of your culture.\"**\n\n**\u2014Jeffrey K.

The book also reaches beyond Toyota to explain issues of human behavior in organizations and provide specific answers to questions such as:\n\n- How can we make improvement and adaptation part of everyday work throughout the organization?\n- How can we develop and utilize the capability of everyone in the organization to repeatedly work toward and achieve new levels of performance?\n- How can we give an organization the power to handle dynamic, unpredictable situations and keep satisfying customers?\n\nMike Rother explains how to improve our prevailing management approach through the use of two kata: Improvement Kata--a repeating routine of establishing challenging target conditions, working step-by-step through obstacles, and always learning from the problems we encounter; and Coaching Kata: a pattern of teaching the improvement kata to employees at every level to ensure it motivates their ways of thinking and acting.\n\nWith clear detail, an abundance of practical examples, and a cohesive explanation from start to finish, _Toyota Kata_ gives executives and managers at any level actionable routines of thought and behavior that produce superior results and sustained competitive advantage.\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| | | |\n\n[Preview this book \u00bb](https://books.google.com/books?id=rFDq1DYprzYC&printsec=frontcover) |\n\n### Selected

        "snippet": "[Skip to main content](https://www.ame.org/kata-resources#main-content)\n\n# Kata Resources\n\nToyota Kata was developed by Mike Rother, a researcher, engineer, teacher, author and speaker on the subjects of management, leadership, improvement, adaptiveness and change in human organizations. In his 2009 book, \u201cToyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results,\u201d Rother describes Toyota Kata as a means for developing, activating and mobilizing human potential in a way that makes scientific thinking a daily habit.\n\nIn \u201cThe Toyota Kata Practice Guide,\u201d Rother describes scientific thinking as, \u201ca continuous comparison between what we predict will happen next, seeing what actually happens and adjusting our understanding and actions based on what we learn from the difference.\u201d\n\n![Toyota Kata Learning image](https://www.ame.org/files/learning_graphic_0.jpg)\n\nUsers can implement scientific thinking by practicing the Improvement Kata, which is one of the main elements within Toyota Kata. This Improvement Kata is a series of steps that provide a mindset for problem solving. These steps include:\n\n- **![Improvement Kata model](https://www.ame.org/files/improvement_kata_model.jpg)Understand the challenge.** This is typically a large, big-picture goal that may seem or feel out of reach. It also defines the purpose or reason behind improvement.\n- **Grasp the current condition.** This step invites users to ask, \u201cWhere are we now?\u201d and includes the gathering of data and information that sets up the next step.\n- **Establish the next target condition.** Where do we want to go? What do we want to achieve? In this step, participants set tangible and measurable goals which include an achieve-by date, desired outcome and a general description of the process on how the target condition will be reached. Important to note, this step is part of the planning phase and is likely to change depending on the results of experimentation and achievement of milestones along the journey.\n- **Experiment toward the target condition.** This step is part of the execution stage and includes the actions needed to reach the target condition. The path towards the target condition is typically not a straight line and usually involves obstacles. This step usually involves a process of rapid learning and discovery of the steps that are working and those which are not. In this step, adjustments are made on the way to the target condition.\n\nThe steps outlined in the Improvement Kata are designed to help users, no matter which problem-solving or improvement method they are using.\n\nImplementing the Improvement Kata can be difficult because it often requires a new or different way of thinking and learners may revert to old patterns and habits. In addition, it can be difficult for learners to see where they are going wrong or making mistakes throughout the process. That\u2019s where the other main element of Toyota Kata comes in.\u00a0 Known as the Coaching Kata, this element of Kata focuses on the practice of teaching the Improvement Kata pattern.\n\nAn Improvement Kata coach helps provides guidance and support for learners and can help speed up the learning process. The coach helps the learner overcome setbacks, provides encouragement and has a vested interest in helping the learner succeed. Coaching however, also takes practice.\n\n[![Daily Kata coaching cycle](https://www.ame.org/files/the_daily_kata_coaching_cycle_0.jpeg)](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/KATA_Files/5Q_Card.pdf) Coaching cycles are a routine for helping the learner understand and acquire the scientific thinking pattern of the Improvement Kata. These cycles include a series of questions and opportunity for feedback. Coaching Kata is a dialogue between coach and learner and each cycle typically runs under 20 minutes and consists of five questions:\n\n\\- What is the target condition?\n\n\\- What is the actual condition now?\n\n\\- What obstacles do you think are preventing your from reaching the target condition? Which one are you addressing now?\n\n\\- What is your next step? (Next experiment) What do you expect?\n\n\\- How quickly can we go and see what we have learned from taking that step?\n\nThese questions, considered the coaching cycle, help reinforce the pattern of the Improvement Kata and helps reveal how the learner is thinking. Typically, this pattern of coaching includes asking a question, listening, comparing (the learner\u2019s response to the desired pattern of thinking), and instructing.\n\nThe use of these Coaching Kata questions takes practice. With feedback from a second coach, these skills can be improved and become more effective.\n\nFor more detail on how to develop the scientific thinking skills of the Improvement Kata or the coaching skills of the Coaching Kata, consult Mike Rother\u2019s \u201cThe Toyota Kata Practice Guide.\u201d For more information about Toyota Kata visit [Mike Rother's Toyota Kata website](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/Homepage.html).\n\n_Images provided by Mike Rother_\n\n### **Mike Rother keynote at AME San Diego 2018:**\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bypjjo3Vuro)\n\n### **Mike Rother's Kata in the Classroom session from AME San Diego 2018:**\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/829NkN_lQdc)\n\n### **Mike Rother's Introduction to Kata video:**\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1l68cFskC7Y)\n\n* * *\n\n## **Compact Kata Online Course - $70 for AME Members**\n\n![](https://www.ame.org/files/kataonlinelearningscreenshot.png)The Online Improvement Kata & Coaching Kata Basics Course is a self-paced, interactive online course in 11 modules.

2\nThe Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata are about teaching a\nsystematic and scientific way of working throughout an\norganization, to get better at reaching difficult goals.\nFor most organizations this will be a change process that involves\nhaving people develop new skills and mindset through deliberate,\ncoached practice. Managers guide the development of their\npeople\u02bcs skills by coaching them in daily practice on real goals. Of\ncourse, those managers will have to be among the first to practice\nand learn the new skills themselves, before they can coach others.\nIntentionally changing an organization\u02bcs culture is a significant\nundertaking. In this case there are scientific skills (the Improvement\nKata pattern) and teaching/coaching skills (the Coaching Kata). This\nSlideShare describes a well-tested approach for deploying IK/CK skill\ndevelopment in an organization.

It\u02bcs a process of developing\nnew skill and mindset throughout an organization, not just a\nproblem-solving approach to implement.\nTo bring the pattern of the Improvement Kata into the\noperation of your organization and make it a habit, mid-level\nmanagement will have to actively coach it every day.\nYou may think deploying simply means getting people in the\norganization to start practicing the Improvement Kata, but in\nour experience an effort to deploy the Improvement Kata\nneeds to be monitored and guided.

The scouts should take an Improvement Kata course, such as as\nthe ones offered by the University of Michigan and the Lean Enterprise Institute.\nPHASE II:\nNow the team of scouts better understands the scope of the task and how much it\u02bcs\nabout culture change through deliberate practice. If the organization is still interested\nat this point then the next step is to form an Advance Group of about 5 people who will\noversee the deployment. This group should include at least one senior manager.\nAt this point an external coach can start working with the organization by coaching the\nAdvance Group. The external coach does not have responsibility for bringing the\nImprovement Kata into the organization. That\u02bcs the responsibility of the Advance Group,\nwhich can\u02bct be delegated. Note that the Advance Group is not the start of a cascade,\nbut rather a group that will conduct PDCA of skill development at the organization level.\nAt this point the Advance Group practices applying the Improvement Kata to selected\nwork processes, under guidance of the external coach, in order to learn the\nImprovement Kata. This takes about 2 months.\nPHASE III:\nNow you can expand into the normal daily activity of middle managers by focusing on\napplying the Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata at work processes and their\nassociated chain of persons. You add processes as coaching capacity permits.\nThe Advance Group now monitors and shepherds the skill-development process.\nA THREE-PHASE DEPLOYMENT APPROACH\nOne way to bring the Improvement Kata into an organization\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/deploying-110425150644-phpapp02/75/How-to-Deploy-the-Improvement-Kata-v7-0-17-2048.jpg)\n![How to Deploy the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 18\nTHE THREE-PHASE DEPLOYMENT APPROACH\nSupervisorsAdvance\nGroup\nPractices\nthe IK\nSenior\nManagers\nArea\nManagers\nSkill-Dev\nPlan\nPrepare\nForm an\nAdvance\nGroup\nScouts\nstudy the\nsubject\nBuilding\nPractice\nSkill\nPractice\nAwareness\nHave a few \u02bbScouts\u02bc\nfamiliarize themselves\nwith the subject; by\nreading \u02bbToyota Kata\u02bc\n&amp; \u02bbThe Talent Code\u02bc,\nand taking a Toyota\nKata course.\nPHASE I PHASE II\nPHASE III - Expansion into\nnormal business process of\nline managers, slice by slice\nPractice\nBuilding\nPractice\nSkill\nPractice\nAwareness\nCoaching\nCycles\nDaily\nExternal coach\nneeded here!\nThe basic deployment process is to\npractice the Improvement Kata pattern\nat one management level and pass it\ndown another level through one-on-\none coaching; so the behavior pattern\npermeates the organization.\nThe Advance Group observes and\nPDCAs the skill-development process\nPractice\nAwareness\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/deploying-110425150644-phpapp02/75/How-to-Deploy-the-Improvement-Kata-v7-0-18-2048.jpg)\n![How to Deploy the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 19\nPHASE III: EXPANDING SLICE BY SLICE\n\u2022A slice = a process and it\u02bcs associated chain of persons.\n\u2022Add slices only as your coaching capacity permits.\n\u2022Once you start applying the Improvement Kata to a process\nyou should never stop.

What are you trying to achieve?\nLean tools are brought in (pulled) situationally as needed.\nThe mindset you\u02bcre trying to develop is one of working\niteratively to discover and do what is necessary to\nachieve a goal, as opposed to a mindset of pushing and\nimplementing pre-defined solutions or tools.\nFor example, if a kanban system will help a team achieve\nits target condition, then at that point kanban is brought\nin and utilized.

Typically these are compact processes that\nhave repetitive cycles. With beginners the primary goal is to\ninternalize the Improvement Kata pattern, not to address the\nmost complicated processes and problems.\nThe development of internal Kata coaches is a prerequisite\nfor teaching people how to work with the Improvement Kata\nevery day. However, at the start there are no experienced\ncoaches.\nTo bridge this gap you can do Phase II Advance Group\npracticing in a rotation model, whereby each person in turn\ntakes the role of Learner, Coach and 2nd Coach. This is a\ntemporary, artificial structure for Advance Group practicing\nand to quickly develop some internal coaching capacity.\nRemember, you can select a few extra persons to practice\ntogether with the Advance group, so you\u02bcll have a few more\ncoaches for the initial deployment.

It\ntakes considerable practice and regular reflection to\nmaster the intent and pattern of the Coaching Kata.\nFor the Coach, coaching cycles are not only a means of\nteaching the Improvement Kata pattern but also a PDCA\ncycle whereby the Coach checks and reflects on the result\nof his/her last coaching. If the Learner isn\u02bct learning the\nImprovement Kata or a team is not achieving its target\nconditions the problem is usually in the coaching.\nIn other words, the Coach is practicing the Coaching Kata\nand for this needs someone with coaching experience to\nperiodically observe him conducting coaching cycles and\nprovide feedback (to coach the coach). That\u02bcs the role of\nthe 2nd coach.\nPeriodic observation of coaching cycles by an\nexperienced second coach is essential if you want\nto teach managers effective coaching skills.\n](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/deploying-110425150644-phpapp02/75/How-to-Deploy-the-Improvement-Kata-v7-0-52-2048.jpg)\n![How to Deploy the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 53\n2nd Coach\nParticipates\nperiodically\n(eg. once / week)\nPays particular\nattention to the Coach\n(coaches the Coach)\nLearner\u02bcs\nStoryboard\nProcess\nLearnerCoach\n(Manager)\nCoach is responsible for\nteaching the Improvement Kata\npattern, and for the results\nLearner &amp;

Managers guide the development of their\npeople\u02bcs skills by coaching them in daily practice on real goals. Of\ncourse, those managers will have to be among the first to practice\nand learn the new skills themselves, before they can coach others.\nIntentionally changing an organization\u02bcs culture is a significant\nundertaking. In this case there are scientific skills (the Improvement\nKata pattern) and teaching/coaching skills (the Coaching Kata). This\nSlideShare describes a well-tested approach for deploying IK/CK skill\ndevelopment in an organization. It is intended to be an input to your\nown deployment process and discoveries.\nINTRODUCTION\nMike Rother\n* 3.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#3)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 3\nWHAT IT\u02bcS ALL ABOUT:\n-- Learning Scientific Skills --\nThe Improvement Kata &amp; Coaching Kata\ncombine a scientific working pattern\nwith techniques of deliberate practice,\nto make scientific thinking a teachable\nmeta-skill that anyone can learn.\nThese foundational thinking habits are the basis for:\n\u2022Learning how to successfully\npursue seemingly unattainable\ngoals in complex systems.\n\u2022Enabling teams who are nearer to\na situation to make their own\ndecisions &amp; maneuver effectively.\n* 4.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#4)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 4\nMike\nGerd\nBill\nBeth\nWE\u02bcVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DEPLOYING\nIMPROVEMENT-KATA SKILL DEVELOPMENT\nPracticing the Improvement Kata helps anyone get better at\nnavigating unknown territory and meeting challenges.

It\u02bcs about a\ndifferent way of managing, not just adding techniques on top\nof how you currently manage. It\u02bcs a process of developing\nnew skill and mindset throughout an organization, not just a\nproblem-solving approach to implement.\nTo bring the pattern of the Improvement Kata into the\noperation of your organization and make it a habit, mid-level\nmanagement will have to actively coach it every day.\nYou may think deploying simply means getting people in the\norganization to start practicing the Improvement Kata, but in\nour experience an effort to deploy the Improvement Kata\nneeds to be monitored and guided. To do that be sure to\nEstablish an \u02bbAdvance Group\u02bc as described in this document.\nR\uf052\nR\uf052\nR\uf052\nLessons\nLearned\n* 13.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#13)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 13\nA gating factor is how much Coaching-Kata capability you\nare developing in your organization. You cannot expand\nwider and faster than your coaching capacity.\nTo be able to coach the Improvement Kata, a person has to\nknow how to do the Improvement Kata. Demonstrated\nproficiency with the Improvement Kata is ideally required\nbefore starting to coach.\nIt&#x27;s not sufficient for the organization&#x27;s leaders to simply\nsay they support the working pattern of the Improvement\nKata.

The scouts should take an Improvement Kata course, such as as\nthe ones offered by the University of Michigan and the Lean Enterprise Institute.\nPHASE II:\nNow the team of scouts better understands the scope of the task and how much it\u02bcs\nabout culture change through deliberate practice. If the organization is still interested\nat this point then the next step is to form an Advance Group of about 5 people who will\noversee the deployment. This group should include at least one senior manager.\nAt this point an external coach can start working with the organization by coaching the\nAdvance Group. The external coach does not have responsibility for bringing the\nImprovement Kata into the organization. That\u02bcs the responsibility of the Advance Group,\nwhich can\u02bct be delegated. Note that the Advance Group is not the start of a cascade,\nbut rather a group that will conduct PDCA of skill development at the organization level.\nAt this point the Advance Group practices applying the Improvement Kata to selected\nwork processes, under guidance of the external coach, in order to learn the\nImprovement Kata.

Typically these are compact processes that\nhave repetitive cycles. With beginners the primary goal is to\ninternalize the Improvement Kata pattern, not to address the\nmost complicated processes and problems.\nThe development of internal Kata coaches is a prerequisite\nfor teaching people how to work with the Improvement Kata\nevery day. However, at the start there are no experienced\ncoaches.\nTo bridge this gap you can do Phase II Advance Group\npracticing in a rotation model, whereby each person in turn\ntakes the role of Learner, Coach and 2nd Coach. This is a\ntemporary, artificial structure for Advance Group practicing\nand to quickly develop some internal coaching capacity.\nRemember, you can select a few extra persons to practice\ntogether with the Advance group, so you\u02bcll have a few more\ncoaches for the initial deployment. (Eventually middle\nmanagers will be the coaches.)\nR\uf052\nR\uf052\n* 33.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#33)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 33\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nGroup 3\nLearnerCoach2nd\nCoach\nProcess 2\nProcess and\nSupervisor\nProcess 1\nProcess 3\nEXAMPLE\n\u2022Select 3 processes with 3 persons practicing per process.

We underestimate\nwhat\u02bcs involved in coaching and what it takes to learn it. It\ntakes considerable practice and regular reflection to\nmaster the intent and pattern of the Coaching Kata.\nFor the Coach, coaching cycles are not only a means of\nteaching the Improvement Kata pattern but also a PDCA\ncycle whereby the Coach checks and reflects on the result\nof his/her last coaching. If the Learner isn\u02bct learning the\nImprovement Kata or a team is not achieving its target\nconditions the problem is usually in the coaching.\nIn other words, the Coach is practicing the Coaching Kata\nand for this needs someone with coaching experience to\nperiodically observe him conducting coaching cycles and\nprovide feedback (to coach the coach). That\u02bcs the role of\nthe 2nd coach.\nPeriodic observation of coaching cycles by an\nexperienced second coach is essential if you want\nto teach managers effective coaching skills.\n* 53.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#53)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 53\n2nd Coach\nParticipates\nperiodically\n(eg. once / week)\nPays particular\nattention to the Coach\n(coaches the Coach)\nLearner\u02bcs\nStoryboard\nProcess\nLearnerCoach\n(Manager)\nCoach is responsible for\nteaching the Improvement Kata\npattern, and for the results\nLearner &amp; Team own\nthe target condition\nand work to achieve it\nTeam\nTHE ROLE OF THE 2nd COACH\nThe 2nd Coach\u02bcs role is to ensure that middle managers are\nteaching/coaching the Improvement Kata correctly.\nThe 2nd Coach does this primarily by observing a managers\u02bc\ncoaching cycles.\n* 54.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#54)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 54\nA COACHING CYCLE IN ACTION\n* 55.\n[How to Deploy](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-deploy-the-improvement-kata/7730624#55)the Improvement Kata\u00a9 Mike Rother 55\nSummary:\nIMPROVEMENT KATA PRACTICE\nIS BRAIN TRAINING!\nDetailed practice instructions are available in the\nonline Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata Practice\nGuide, which is available on the Toyota Kata Website\nDownload"

Teams using the Improvement Kata learn and adapt based on what they\u2019ve discovered\u00a0while on their journey to reaching their Target Condition.\n\n![The Improvement Kata](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kata.png)\n\nCoaching Kata\n\nThe Coaching Kata is a practice routine for teaching the **Improvement Kata** pattern.\n\nAs with every skill, practicing should be done under regular observation of\u00a0an experienced coach. Without coaching we lose our way and don\u2019t practice the correct pattern, or become inefficient in our practice.\n\nOnce **Improvement Kata** is learned, the **Coaching Kata** develops your skill for teaching the Improvement Kata pattern in everyday work environments. The Coaching Kata is a practice routine specifically for teaching a scientific working pattern like the Improvement Kata.\n\n## Coaching Cycles\n\nThe core practice routine of the Coaching Kata is Coaching Cycles. One coaching cycle involves the Coach asking the **Five Coaching Kata Questions** of the learner while using the PDCA Cycles Record. This is done daily at a regularly scheduled time.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/_es3hYCMMmc?feature=oembed)\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3G0V7Wthbc?feature=oembed)\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5QVC2kW5ww?feature=oembed)\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqZOu1D639Q?feature=oembed)\n\n2017 Kata Practitioner Day Videos\n\n[2017 Arkansas Kata Practitioner Day - Full Video](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/KataPractitionerDay-FULL.mp4)[Toyota Kata: Daily Practice for Scientific Skill, Mindset, and Culture Video](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/1-Rother-ToyotaKata.mp4)[MPG Gear Technologies - Video Presentation](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/2-MPG.mp4)[NIce Pak - Video Presentation](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/3-NicePak.mp4)[Baptist Health - Video Presentation](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/5-BaptistHealth.mp4)[KiC Puzzle Exercise](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/6-Rother-Exercise.mp4)[Kata in the Classroom](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/7-KataClassroom.mp4)[Kata: Arkansas Economic Development Commission Presentation](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/8-AEDC.mp4)[Q&A with Mike Rother](http://video1.aetn.org/vod/edu/videos/9-Rother-QA.mp4)\n\n2017 Kata Practitioner Day Presentations\n\n[![Nice Pak](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nice-pak.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NICE-PAK-KATA-JOURNEY-032917.pdf) Nice Pak Transformational Journey (So Far)\n\n[![Baptist](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/baptist.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/BMHC-KATA-JOURNEY-032917.pdf) Baptist - Continuously Improving the Way We Write Obstacles\n\n[![AEDC](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/aedc.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AEDC-KATA-JOURNEY-032917.pdf) AEDC Development Commission\n\n[![Rother Video 1 Link](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rother-video-1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g) Neuroplasticity\n\n[![Career Ed Presentation](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/career-ed-presentation.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/KATA-in-the-Classroom-kelli.pdf) Arkansas Career & Technical Education - Kata In The Classroom\n\n[![MPG Gear](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MPG-Gear.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MPG-GEAR-KATA-JOURNEY-032917.pdf) MPG Gear Technologies - The Kata Journey\n\n[![Almatis](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/almatis.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ALMATIS-KATA-JOURNEY-032917.pdf) Almatis Bauxite - Transformation Using Kata\n\n[![Rother Presentation](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rother-presentation.png)](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Rother-Presentation.pptx) Mike Rother's Toyota Kata Daily Practice for Scientific-Thinking Skills, Mindset & Culture Presentation\n\n[![BJ Fogg: Baby Steps for Behavior Change](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rother-video-2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfAQ8oJIGoA) BJ Fogg: Baby Steps for Behavior Change\n\n[Go to Top](https://www.mfgsolutions.org/toyotakata/)"

Rother is a best-selling author with previous affiliations with the University of Michigan, Industrial Technology Institute, Fraunhofer Institute and Technical University Dortmund. His most recent book, \u201cToyota Kata\u201d examines the improvement Kata, which is a teachable, repeatable routine that makes scientific working a daily habit and provides a clear path for leveraging human potential.
