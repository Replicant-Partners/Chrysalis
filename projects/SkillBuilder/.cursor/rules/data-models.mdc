## Core Data Structures

### ParsedMode Model
**Importance Score: 95**
Located in `semantic_mode/pipeline/models.py`
- Represents the fundamental mode definition
- Contains collections of skill cards, semantic relationships, and domain anchors
- Serves as the bridge between raw markdown and transformed output formats
- Maintains bidirectional mappings between skills and their semantic connections

### Skill Card Structure 
**Importance Score: 90**
Located in `semantic_synthesis/src/semantic_mode/synthesis.clj`
- Defines the atomic unit of agent capabilities
- Components include:
  - Triggers: Activation conditions and contexts
  - Artifacts: Expected outputs and deliverables
  - Constraints: Operating boundaries and limitations
  - Evidence URLs: Supporting documentation and examples
- Maintains references to related skills through semantic connections

### Semantic Map
**Importance Score: 85**
Located in `pkg/search/models.go`
- Graph structure representing relationships between skills
- Edge types define relationship categories:
  - Prerequisite links
  - Enhancement connections 
  - Alternative implementations
- Supports domain anchor inference and skill grouping

### Search Result Models
**Importance Score: 75**
Located in `pkg/search/models.go`
- Structured representation of search results
- Contains:
  - Relevance scoring
  - Domain classification
  - Source credibility metrics
  - Content extraction mappings

### Mode Generation Context
**Importance Score: 70**
Located in `semantic_mode/pipeline/models.py`
- Maintains state during mode generation
- Tracks:
  - Discovered domain anchors
  - Skill inference confidence scores
  - Relationship strength metrics
  - Generation progress indicators
