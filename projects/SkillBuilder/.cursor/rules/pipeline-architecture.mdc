description: Technical specification for semantic mode pipeline architecture, handling orchestration, stage sequencing and artifact generation

# pipeline-architecture

The pipeline architecture consists of three major components that work together to generate semantic modes:

## Core Pipeline Runner
File: `semantic_mode/pipeline/runner.py`
Importance Score: 85

- Orchestrates multi-stage pipeline execution:
  1. Search swarm initialization and execution
  2. Semantic synthesis processing
  3. Artifact generation and persistence

- Manages pipeline state and data flow between stages
- Coordinates telemetry collection across pipeline stages
- Handles dry-run preview functionality

## Search Swarm Architecture
Files: 
- `pkg/search/swarm.go`
- `semantic_mode/pipeline/search.py`
Importance Score: 80

- Two-stage search execution:
  1. Exemplar discovery phase
  2. Standards/reference model enrichment phase
- Search provider abstraction layer supporting multiple backends
- Result aggregation and domain anchor inference
- Composite backend with provider fallback mechanisms

## Semantic Synthesis Pipeline
Files:
- `semantic_synthesis/src/semantic_mode/synthesis.clj`
- `semantic_mode/pipeline/transformer.py`
Importance Score: 75

- Multi-step synthesis process:
  1. Skill extraction from search results
  2. Skill card generation with attributes
  3. HuggingFace skills integration
  4. Mode merging and consolidation
- Transformation pipeline for different output formats
- Markdown artifact generation
