# search-swarm-algorithms

## Two-Stage Search Process
`pkg/search/swarm.go`
Importance Score: 85

The search swarm implements a dual-phase research algorithm:
1. Exemplar Discovery: Initial broad search targeting exemplars and high-quality references
2. Standards Analysis: Focused search using discovered domain anchors to find relevant standards and reference models

## Domain Anchor Inference
`pkg/search/swarm.go`
Importance Score: 80

Analyzes first-stage search results to extract domain anchors:
- Identifies recurring terminology and concepts
- Extracts authoritative sources and standards bodies
- Builds weighted anchor terms for second-stage search refinement

## Result Aggregation Pipeline
`pkg/search/models.go`
Importance Score: 75

Multi-provider result aggregation system:
- Deduplicates results across search providers
- Ranks hits based on domain relevance scoring
- Merges related results into consolidated entries
- Preserves source attribution and confidence scores

## Search Backend Federation
`semantic_mode/pipeline/search.py`
Importance Score: 70

Composite search provider architecture:
- Distributes searches across multiple backend providers
- Implements provider-specific query adaptation
- Handles provider fallback and failover
- Normalizes results into unified format
