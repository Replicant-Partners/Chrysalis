## Core Synthesis Components

### Skill Inference Engine
**File:** `semantic_synthesis/src/semantic_mode/synthesis.clj`
**Importance Score:** 85
- Extracts skills from search result content using domain-specific regex patterns
- Maps raw skills to structured skill definitions with attributes like:
  - Triggers
  - Required artifacts
  - Domain constraints
  - Evidence URLs
- Integrates with HuggingFace skills repository for skill enrichment

### Mode Merging Logic  
**File:** `semantic_synthesis/src/semantic_mode/synthesis.clj`
**Importance Score:** 80
- Combines seeded mode templates with generated skill cards
- Resolves conflicts between existing and new skills
- Maintains skill relationship graphs
- Generates semantic maps showing skill dependencies

### Pipeline Orchestration
**File:** `semantic_mode/pipeline/runner.py`
**Importance Score:** 75
- Coordinates between search swarm and synthesis stages
- Manages artifact generation workflow
- Handles skill card materialization
- Controls mode merging sequence

### Skill Card Generation
**File:** `semantic_synthesis/src/semantic_mode/synthesis.clj`
**Importance Score:** 70
- Transforms raw skills into structured skill cards
- Adds metadata including:
  - Skill confidence scores
  - Usage examples
  - Related skills
  - Source documentation

### Search Result Processing
**File:** `semantic_mode/pipeline/transformer.py` 
**Importance Score:** 65
- Parses search results into synthesis-compatible format
- Extracts relevant skill indicators
- Maps domain terminology to skill definitions
- Prepares content for skill inference
