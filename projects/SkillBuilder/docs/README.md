# SkillBuilder Documentation Index

Welcome to the SkillBuilder documentation. This repository is organized to serve both human operators designing complex agents and the agents themselves, focusing on minimizing information loss and maximizing utility.

## Current vs Archive
- Current docs live in this folder; they track the implemented pipeline and CLI.
- Archived / non-current docs are in [docs/archive/](archive/README.md) and include historical references like [Custom-Modes](archive/Custom-Modes.md).
