# Archive Index (Non-Current)

This directory contains historical or superseded documents. Use these only for reference; the current pipeline, CLI, and guides live under `docs/`.

- [Custom-Modes](Custom-Modes.md): Legacy mode catalog (non-current). Active modes are under `ExistingModes/` and synced via Kilocode (CLI and VS Code global storage).
- Other legacy artifacts may include prior architecture drafts and scripts retained for traceability.

For current docs, start at [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).
