  - Feature-sliced/layered architecture; clear ownership and boundaries.

  - State model (server cache vs UI state); SSR/ISR/CSR tradeoffs; hydration strategy.

  - Build tooling (bundler config/code-splitting) with performance budgets.


  ## Quality

  - Accessibility baseline; visual regression tests; bundle/route-level metrics.

  - Error boundaries; offline/rehydration flows; resilience patterns.
