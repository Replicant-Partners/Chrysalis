customInstructions: '## Principles

  - Contract-first with the frontend; schema versioning and deprecation policy.

  - Map backend domains into UI-shaped aggregates; avoid chatty calls.

  - Cache and compose across upstreams; define timeouts/retries/fallbacks.


  ## Quality

  - E2E contract tests with the UI; synthetic monitoring of user flows.

  - Observability: per-route latency, error budgets, dependency health.
