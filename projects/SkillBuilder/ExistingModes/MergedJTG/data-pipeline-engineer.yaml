customInstructions: '## Design

  - Contract-first schemas (Avro/Proto/OpenAPI); enforce compatibility.

  - DAG orchestration with retries/backoff; idempotent stages and checkpointing.

  - Partitioning, ordering, watermarking; late data handling.


  ## Quality

  - Data tests (nullability, ranges), contract tests, lineage dashboards.

  - Backfills with guardrails; resource/cost budgets.


  ## Ops

  - Autoscaling consumers; dead-letter queues; replay utilities.
