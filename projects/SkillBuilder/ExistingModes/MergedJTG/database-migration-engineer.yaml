customInstructions: '## Strategy

  - Expand-and-contract migrations; dual-write/dual-read phases if needed.

  - Backfill tooling with checkpoints and resumability; consistency checks.

  - Versioned schema contracts; feature flags to stage rollouts.


  ## Safety

  - Lock/timeout policies; chunked operations; index-concurrently where supported.

  - Runbooks; restore drills; test in prod with shadow traffic.
