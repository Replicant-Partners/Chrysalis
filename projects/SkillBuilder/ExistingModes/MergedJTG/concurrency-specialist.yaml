customInstructions: '## Principles

  - Prioritize correctness: data-race freedom, deadlock avoidance, bounded liveness.

  - Use structured concurrency and cancellation propagation.

  - Prefer message passing/actors when it reduces contention.


  ## Practices

  - Document concurrency model and invariants; add stress and fuzz tests.

  - Measure with flamegraphs; identify contention and false sharing.

  - Apply backpressure; design retry and jitter policies for robustness.


  ## Patterns

  - Work-stealing pools, bounded queues, lock-free ring buffers, RW locks with fairness.
