# Universal Agent Lexicon (OODA + Interrogatives)

## Core Entities
- **Agent**: autonomous process with cryptographic identity; implements UniversalAgent schema and participates in experience sync and morphing across MCP/multi_agent/orchestrated modes.
- **Identity**: SHA-384 fingerprint + Ed25519 keys; anchors accountability and signing of experience/state transfers.
- **Instance**: running agent copy with transport, sync protocol, health, and stats; unit of observation in OODA loops.
- **Experience**: episodic records (interactions, outcomes, lessons); feeds skill/knowledge updates and sync merges.
- **Memory**: episodic + semantic stores (vector/graph/hybrid); convergence and deduplication rules govern merges.
- **Skill**: profiled capability with proficiency, learning curve, usage stats, synergies; aggregated across instances.
- **Knowledge/Concept**: named semantic node with definition, relations, confidence, provenance; forms graph substrate.
- **Tool**: MCP/native/API action with usage metrics; bound to instances and governed by transport policy.
- **Pattern**: validated primitive (hash, signature, random, gossip, DAG, convergence, redundancy, threshold, logical time, CRDT); resolved per context via PatternResolver.
- **Morphing**: lossless conversion between agent implementations with shadow fields to preserve fidelity.

## Fabrics and Resolution
- **Pattern Resolver**: chooses implementation source (mcp | embedded | library) based on deployment context (distributed, mcp_available, performance_critical, prefer_reusability) and logs rationale.
- **MCP Fabric**: cryptographic-primitives + distributed-structures servers delivering networked pattern operations.
- **Embedded Patterns**: local TypeScript implementations for low-latency, single-node use.
- **Adaptive Deployment**: hybrid choice per pattern call; favors reusability (MCP) vs latency (embedded) vs simplicity (library).

## Synchronization and State
- **Experience Sync**: streaming | lumped | check_in protocols over https | websocket | mcp transports; merges via conflict resolution and deduplication.
- **Evolution Tracking**: DAG of state transitions with logical time and fingerprints to support traceability.
- **Aggregation**: convergence/threshold functions (median, trimmed mean, supermajority) for byzantine-resistant merging.

## OODA + Interrogative Matrix
Each cell defines the question the agent must answer for the step; populate from memories, tools, peers, and current context.

| OODA Step | Who | What | When | Where | Why | How | Huh? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observe | sources/actors emitting signals | events, deltas, anomalies | timestamps, cadence | locations, channels | purpose of signal, stakes | collection methods, sensors | gaps in sensing or missing signals |
| Orient | stakeholders, roles | state, patterns, priors | temporal ordering, recency | topology, neighborhood | causal hypotheses | models, transforms, embeddings | contradictions, unknown priors |
| Decide | accountable owners | candidate options | deadlines, horizons | execution surface | objectives, success criteria | plans, playbooks, resource maps | unresolved risks, missing options |
| Act | executors/peers | chosen action/tool | schedule, latency | target system/path | rationale communicated | protocols, APIs, safeguards | failed effects, surprises, retries |

## Biomimetic Mapping
- **Gossip ↔ Mycelial/rumor spread**: resilient, redundant propagation of experiences.
- **DAG ↔ Causal chains**: lineage of actions akin to ancestry; preserves provenance.
- **Threshold/Convergence ↔ Group consensus**: median-based agreement mirrors crowds finding robust norms.
- **Episodic/Semantic Memory ↔ Human memory**: time-bound episodes feeding abstract concepts and skills.
- **Morphing ↔ Metamorphosis**: retain identity while adapting body (implementation) to environment.

## Population and Learning Loop
- Fill OODA cells from instance stats, recent episodes, semantic graph queries, tool outputs, and peer syncs.
- After Act, record new episodes, update skills/knowledge, and feed back into Observe/Orient.
- Maintain fingerprints and evolution DAG entries for every loop to keep trail auditable.
