# Chrysalis Memory System - Dependencies
# Pattern-based agent memory built on universal distributed systems principles

# Core Cryptography (Pattern #1 + #2)
cryptography>=41.0.0  # Ed25519 signatures, SHA-384 hashing

# Optional: For production deployments
# aiohttp>=3.9.0  # Async HTTP for gossip protocol
# pydantic>=2.0.0  # Data validation
