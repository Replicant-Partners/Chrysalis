## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Universal Protocol Translation System orchestrates semantic-based protocol adaptation and translation between different agent frameworks.

Core Architecture:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 95
- Semantic category mapping system for protocol translation
- Core semantic categories: IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Morphing logic for agent identity preservation

2. Protocol Registry (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts) 
Importance Score: 90
- Verified protocol specifications with semantic hints
- Trust level management and verification timestamps
- Protocol field mappings and transformation rules
- Fallback schemas for offline operation

3. Universal Adapter Core (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
Importance Score: 85
- LLM-delegated protocol translation engine
- Dynamic protocol discovery and registration
- Specification caching and validation
- Bidirectional translation verification

Key Integration Points:

1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Maps fields by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Uses LLM for cross-protocol concept understanding
- Maintains semantic integrity during translations

2. Protocol Trust System
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification and expiration handling
- Offline operation fallback mechanisms

3. Agent Morphing
- Identity preservation across protocol transformations 
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation

The system replaces traditional adapter patterns with an AI-driven universal translation layer for protocol interoperability in agent systems.
