Universal Protocol Translation System orchestrates semantic-based protocol adaptation and translation between different agent frameworks.
Core Architecture:
1. Semantic Protocol Translation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 95
- Semantic category mapping system for protocol translation
- Core semantic categories: IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Morphing logic for agent identity preservation
2. Protocol Registry (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts) 
- Verified protocol specifications with semantic hints
- Trust level management and verification timestamps
- Protocol field mappings and transformation rules
- Fallback schemas for offline operation
3. Universal Adapter Core (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
- LLM-delegated protocol translation engine
- Dynamic protocol discovery and registration
- Specification caching and validation
- Bidirectional translation verification
Key Integration Points:
1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Maps fields by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Uses LLM for cross-protocol concept understanding
- Maintains semantic integrity during translations
2. Protocol Trust System
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification and expiration handling
- Offline operation fallback mechanisms
3. Agent Morphing
- Identity preservation across protocol transformations 
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation
The system replaces traditional adapter patterns with an AI-driven universal translation layer for protocol interoperability in agent systems.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Protocol Adaptation Layer
The system implements an advanced protocol interoperability layer enabling cross-agent communication through:

1. Protocol Version Negotiation System
- Anticipatory version negotiation with five strategies: latest, stable, minimum-compatible, exact, best-effort
- Custom fallback path management 
- Location: `src/adapters/adaptation-hooks.ts`
Importance Score: 85

2. Universal Agent Translation 
- LLM-based dynamic protocol translation between agent frameworks
- Semantic category mapping with protocol-specific hints
- Field mapping generation and agent morphing capabilities
- Location: `src/adapters/universal/index.ts`
Importance Score: 90

## Knowledge Management Architecture

1. Memory Fusion System
- Three-tier architecture combining short-term, hybrid local cache, and remote persistent storage
- Implements Byzantine-resistant consensus with >2/3 threshold validation
- CRDT-based conflict-free memory merging
- Location: `memory_system/fusion.py`
Importance Score: 95

2. Skill Building Pipeline
- Exemplar-driven research with semantic analysis
- Neurosymbolic functional clustering of modes
- Schema.org-aligned role mapping
- Location: `projects/SkillBuilder/skill_builder/pipeline/runner.py`
Importance Score: 90

## Agent Evaluation Framework

1. Multi-Agent Evaluation System
- Implements Delphi Method and Tetlock Superforecasting principles
- Four specialized evaluation personas with weighted scoring
- Metacognitive oversight for bias detection
- Location: `src/agents/system/EvaluationCoordinator.ts`
Importance Score: 95

2. Forecast Tracking System
- Brier score calibration for prediction accuracy
- Rolling window calibration statistics
- Impact scoring for protocol modifications
- Location: `src/agents/system/ForecastTracker.ts`
Importance Score: 85
