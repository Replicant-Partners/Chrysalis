## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements an AI agent system with sophisticated memory management and transformation capabilities across multiple frameworks.

Core Business Logic Organization:

1. Memory Architecture Foundation
- Distributed memory system implementing 7 universal patterns
- Byzantine-resistant validation requiring >2/3 consensus
- Pattern-based conflict resolution
- Causal relationship tracking via DAG structure
File: memory_system/chrysalis_memory.py

2. Agent Transformation Layer
- Seamless morphing between agent frameworks 
- Experience preservation across transformations
- Three adaptation patterns: MCP, Multi-Agent, Orchestrated
- Identity continuity management
File: src/core/UniformSemanticAgentV2.ts

3. Knowledge Integration System
- Multi-source knowledge orchestration
- Trust scoring with configurable allowlists
- Schema.org-based entity resolution
- Type-specific attribute scaffolding
File: projects/KnowledgeBuilder/src/pipeline/router.py

4. Experience Synchronization
- Three-tier sync strategy (streaming/lumped/check-in)
- Intelligent memory deduplication
- Progressive confidence boosting
- Cross-instance skill accumulation
File: src/sync/ExperienceSyncManager.ts

5. Agent Meta-Cognition
- Self-reflection capabilities
- Knowledge calibration scoring
- Prediction accuracy tracking
- Cross-agent learning protocols
File: Ludwig_agent_reflection.py

The system architecture emphasizes:
- Distributed consensus mechanisms
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Lossless agent transformation
- Progressive knowledge refinement
- Memory synchronization patterns

This forms a comprehensive framework for building resilient, evolvable AI agents with sophisticated memory and learning capabilities.
