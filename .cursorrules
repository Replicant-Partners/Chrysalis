# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
Universal Protocol Translation System orchestrates semantic-based protocol adaptation and translation between different agent frameworks.
Core Architecture:
1. Semantic Protocol Translation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 95
- Semantic category mapping system for protocol translation
- Core semantic categories: IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Morphing logic for agent identity preservation
2. Protocol Registry (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts) 
- Verified protocol specifications with semantic hints
- Trust level management and verification timestamps
- Protocol field mappings and transformation rules
- Fallback schemas for offline operation
3. Universal Adapter Core (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
- LLM-delegated protocol translation engine
- Dynamic protocol discovery and registration
- Specification caching and validation
- Bidirectional translation verification
Key Integration Points:
1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Maps fields by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Uses LLM for cross-protocol concept understanding
- Maintains semantic integrity during translations
2. Protocol Trust System
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification and expiration handling
- Offline operation fallback mechanisms
3. Agent Morphing
- Identity preservation across protocol transformations 
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation
The system replaces traditional adapter patterns with an AI-driven universal translation layer for protocol interoperability in agent systems.

## Core Protocol Adaptation Layer
The system implements an advanced protocol interoperability layer enabling cross-agent communication through:
1. Protocol Version Negotiation System
- Anticipatory version negotiation with five strategies: latest, stable, minimum-compatible, exact, best-effort
- Custom fallback path management 
- Location: `src/adapters/adaptation-hooks.ts`
Importance Score: 85
2. Universal Agent Translation 
- LLM-based dynamic protocol translation between agent frameworks
- Semantic category mapping with protocol-specific hints
- Field mapping generation and agent morphing capabilities
- Location: `src/adapters/universal/index.ts`
## Knowledge Management Architecture
1. Memory Fusion System
- Three-tier architecture combining short-term, hybrid local cache, and remote persistent storage
- Implements Byzantine-resistant consensus with >2/3 threshold validation
- CRDT-based conflict-free memory merging
- Location: `memory_system/fusion.py`
Importance Score: 95
2. Skill Building Pipeline
- Exemplar-driven research with semantic analysis
- Neurosymbolic functional clustering of modes
- Schema.org-aligned role mapping
- Location: `projects/SkillBuilder/skill_builder/pipeline/runner.py`
Importance Score: 90
## Agent Evaluation Framework
1. Multi-Agent Evaluation System
- Implements Delphi Method and Tetlock Superforecasting principles
- Four specialized evaluation personas with weighted scoring
- Metacognitive oversight for bias detection
- Location: `src/agents/system/EvaluationCoordinator.ts`
Importance Score: 95
2. Forecast Tracking System
- Brier score calibration for prediction accuracy
- Rolling window calibration statistics
- Impact scoring for protocol modifications
- Location: `src/agents/system/ForecastTracker.ts`
Importance Score: 85

## Core Architecture
Universal Protocol Translation System organizes AI agent interactions through three main components:
1. Protocol Translation Layer
`src/adapters/universal/index.ts`
- LLM-powered universal adapter translating between agent protocols
- Semantic mapping for protocol conversion
- Protocol registry with versioning and specs
Importance Score: 95
2. Memory Management System
`src/memory/semantic/decomposer.py`
- Multi-tier memory architecture:
  - Working Memory: Short-term context buffer
  - Episodic Memory: Experience storage with Byzantine fault tolerance
  - Semantic Memory: Knowledge consolidation
- CRDT-based distributed memory synchronization
Importance Score: 90
3. Agent Learning Pipeline 
`src/agents/system/EvaluationCoordinator.ts`
- Four specialized evaluation personas (Ada, Lea, Phil, David)
- Weighted consensus mechanism for knowledge validation
- Pattern-based skill accumulation and verification
Importance Score: 85
## Integration Points
The system connects through:
1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Standardized capability definitions
- Cross-protocol field translation
- State synchronization protocols
2. Memory Fusion
- Short-term beads integration
- Fireproof durable cache
- Remote vector search
- Knowledge graph linking
3. Byzantine Trust System
- >2/3 consensus requirement
- Trimmed mean outlier resistance 
- Anti-entropy repair protocols
The architecture emphasizes:
- Protocol-agnostic agent communication
- Distributed memory consistency
- Evidence-based knowledge validation
- Cross-framework compatibility

Universal Protocol Translation System implements cross-framework AI agent communication with three core components:
Protocol Registry and Semantic Translation (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts)
- Maintains protocol mappings between agent frameworks
- Defines semantic equivalence between protocol fields
- Implements protocol-specific field transformations
- Includes semantic hints for LLM-based translations
LLM-Powered Translation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
- Sophisticated protocol translation prompts
- Semantic categories for agent capabilities 
- Bidirectional field mappings between protocols
- Protocol-aware translation strategies
Universal Adapter Core (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
- Single-adapter translation between multiple protocols
- Dynamic protocol registration and validation
- Protocol capability detection and mapping
- Protocol specification fetching and caching
Pattern Detection (src/adapters/adaptation/pattern-sensor-manager.ts)
- Evolutionary pattern detection for translations
- Protocol health metrics and adaptation triggers
- Automatic protocol behavior adjustment
- Protocol conversion quality metrics
Notable Elements:
- Semantic mapping between equivalent concepts across protocols
- Version negotiation with compatibility checks
- Memory synchronization across agent instances
- Byzantine fault tolerance for distributed consensus
- Skill and knowledge synthesis pipelines
The system's core innovation is LLM-powered semantic translation between ANY agent protocol, replacing traditional hard-coded adapters with a single universal translator.
