# protocol-registry

The protocol registry system enables semantic translation and adaptation between different agent communication protocols:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Maintains verified protocol specifications with semantic hints for field mapping
- Implements trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community) for protocol sources
- Features specification caching and validation with expiration timestamps
- Contains fallback schemas for offline operation
Importance Score: 95

2. Field Mapping Engine
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Maps protocol fields by semantic meaning rather than syntax
- Defines core semantic categories (IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE)
- Contains protocol-specific translation hints and mapping rules
- Features specialized morphing logic for identity preservation
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/sync/protocols/trust.ts
- Hierarchical trust level management for protocol specifications
- Automated verification of protocol compliance
- Fallback mechanisms for offline protocol operation
- Cross-protocol compatibility versioning
Importance Score: 85

4. Semantic Hint System 
Path: src/protocol-registry/hints.ts
- Protocol-specific field mapping suggestions
- Semantic equivalence definitions between protocols
- Translation confidence scoring
- Bidirectional verification of translations
Importance Score: 80

The protocol registry implements unique approaches for:
- Semantic understanding vs direct field mapping
- Trust-based protocol verification
- Agent identity preservation during translation
- Protocol capability discovery and matching

description: Specification for protocol registry system handling semantic hints, trust levels, fallbacks and field mappings between agent frameworks
Core Protocol Registry Components:
1. Semantic Hint Management
File: src/adapters/protocol-registry.ts
- Maintains protocol-specific semantic hints for field mappings
- Handles trust levels and reputation scores per protocol
- Provides fallback schema resolution when fields don't match
- Maps protocol capabilities to common semantic categories
Importance Score: 90
2. Protocol Version Registry
File: src/adapters/adaptation-hooks.ts  
- Tracks protocol versions and compatibility matrices
- Manages protocol deprecation and upgrade paths
- Provides version negotiation strategies:
  - latest
  - stable 
  - minimum-compatible
  - exact
  - best-effort
Importance Score: 85
3. Field Mapping System
File: src/adapters/protocol-messages.ts
- Maps fields between different protocol schemas
- Handles complex field transformations
- Provides semantic equivalence checking
- Maintains mapping confidence scores
Importance Score: 80
4. Protocol Health Monitor
File: src/adapters/protocol-registry.ts
- Calculates health scores based on:
  - Protocol maturity level
  - Breaking changes
  - Implementation completeness
  - Deprecation status 
- Provides upgrade path recommendations
Importance Score: 85
5. Trust Scoring Engine
File: src/adapters/protocol-capabilities.ts
- Evaluates protocol reliability and completeness
- Assigns confidence levels to field mappings
- Tracks successful/failed translations
- Adjusts trust scores based on outcomes
Importance Score: 75
The registry system focuses on maintaining protocol compatibility through semantic hints and field mappings while tracking health metrics and trust levels to ensure reliable protocol translations.

# protocol-registry

The protocol registry system implements specialized protocol interoperability with:

1. Protocol Trust Management
Importance Score: 95/100
- Multi-tier trust validation system for protocols:
  * Verified: Cryptographically signed by trusted authority
  * Community: Peer-reviewed and widely adopted
  * Experimental: Limited validation or testing
- Trust score calculation based on:
  * Adoption metrics
  * Bug report history
  * Breaking change frequency
  * Community validation signals

2. Semantic Field Mapping
Importance Score: 90/100
- Core semantic categories with bidirectional mapping:
  * IDENTITY: Agent identification and authentication fields
  * CAPABILITIES: Available tools, skills and permissions
  * INSTRUCTIONS: Behavior guidance and constraints
  * STATE: Memory and context management
  * COMMUNICATION: Message patterns and formats
- Field mapping by semantic meaning rather than syntax
- Fallback mapping rules for partial compatibility

3. Protocol Version Management
Importance Score: 85/100
- Protocol specification versioning with semantic URLs
- Breaking change detection and compatibility matrices
- Protocol deprecation lifecycle management
- Automated migration path generation

4. Protocol Adaptation Layer
Importance Score: 80/100
- Pattern-based protocol evolution detection
- Self-modifying protocol adapters based on usage patterns
- Byzantine fault tolerance for distributed protocol consensus
- Protocol health monitoring and alerting

Key Workflows:
1. Protocol Registration:
- Specification validation
- Trust level assignment
- Field mapping generation
- Version tracking initialization

2. Protocol Evolution:
- Change pattern detection
- Compatibility impact analysis
- Migration path calculation
- Trust level reassessment

The system focuses on maintaining reliable protocol interoperability through semantic understanding rather than rigid syntax mapping.
