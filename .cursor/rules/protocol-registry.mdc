description: Protocol registry specification for managing semantic translation and adaptation of agent communication protocols

# protocol-registry

The protocol registry system enables semantic translation and adaptation between different agent communication protocols:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Maintains verified protocol specifications with semantic hints for field mapping
- Implements trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community) for protocol sources
- Features specification caching and validation with expiration timestamps
- Contains fallback schemas for offline operation
Importance Score: 95

2. Field Mapping Engine
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Maps protocol fields by semantic meaning rather than syntax
- Defines core semantic categories (IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE)
- Contains protocol-specific translation hints and mapping rules
- Features specialized morphing logic for identity preservation
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/sync/protocols/trust.ts
- Hierarchical trust level management for protocol specifications
- Automated verification of protocol compliance
- Fallback mechanisms for offline protocol operation
- Cross-protocol compatibility versioning
Importance Score: 85

4. Semantic Hint System 
Path: src/protocol-registry/hints.ts
- Protocol-specific field mapping suggestions
- Semantic equivalence definitions between protocols
- Translation confidence scoring
- Bidirectional verification of translations
Importance Score: 80

The protocol registry implements unique approaches for:
- Semantic understanding vs direct field mapping
- Trust-based protocol verification
- Agent identity preservation during translation
- Protocol capability discovery and matching
