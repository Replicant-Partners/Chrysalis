description: Protocol registry specification for managing semantic translation and adaptation of agent communication protocols
---


# protocol-registry

The protocol registry system enables semantic translation and adaptation between different agent communication protocols:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Maintains verified protocol specifications with semantic hints for field mapping
- Implements trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community) for protocol sources
- Features specification caching and validation with expiration timestamps
- Contains fallback schemas for offline operation
Importance Score: 95

2. Field Mapping Engine
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Maps protocol fields by semantic meaning rather than syntax
- Defines core semantic categories (IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE)
- Contains protocol-specific translation hints and mapping rules
- Features specialized morphing logic for identity preservation
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/sync/protocols/trust.ts
- Hierarchical trust level management for protocol specifications
- Automated verification of protocol compliance
- Fallback mechanisms for offline protocol operation
- Cross-protocol compatibility versioning
Importance Score: 85

4. Semantic Hint System 
Path: src/protocol-registry/hints.ts
- Protocol-specific field mapping suggestions
- Semantic equivalence definitions between protocols
- Translation confidence scoring
- Bidirectional verification of translations
Importance Score: 80

The protocol registry implements unique approaches for:
- Semantic understanding vs direct field mapping
- Trust-based protocol verification
- Agent identity preservation during translation
- Protocol capability discovery and matching

# protocol-registry

Core Protocol Registry Components:

1. Semantic Hint Management
File: src/adapters/protocol-registry.ts
- Maintains protocol-specific semantic hints for field mappings
- Handles trust levels and reputation scores per protocol
- Provides fallback schema resolution when fields don't match
- Maps protocol capabilities to common semantic categories
Importance Score: 90

2. Protocol Version Registry
File: src/adapters/adaptation-hooks.ts  
- Tracks protocol versions and compatibility matrices
- Manages protocol deprecation and upgrade paths
- Provides version negotiation strategies:
  - latest
  - stable 
  - minimum-compatible
  - exact
  - best-effort
Importance Score: 85

3. Field Mapping System
File: src/adapters/protocol-messages.ts
- Maps fields between different protocol schemas
- Handles complex field transformations
- Provides semantic equivalence checking
- Maintains mapping confidence scores
Importance Score: 80

4. Protocol Health Monitor
File: src/adapters/protocol-registry.ts
- Calculates health scores based on:
  - Protocol maturity level
  - Breaking changes
  - Implementation completeness
  - Deprecation status 
- Provides upgrade path recommendations
Importance Score: 85

5. Trust Scoring Engine
File: src/adapters/protocol-capabilities.ts
- Evaluates protocol reliability and completeness
- Assigns confidence levels to field mappings
- Tracks successful/failed translations
- Adjusts trust scores based on outcomes
Importance Score: 75

The registry system focuses on maintaining protocol compatibility through semantic hints and field mappings while tracking health metrics and trust levels to ensure reliable protocol translations.
