# semantic-categories

The semantic category system implements specialized meaning-based protocol translation:

1. Core Semantic Categories 
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- IDENTITY: Agent self-definition and core traits
- CAPABILITIES: Agent skills and abilities
- INSTRUCTIONS: Command and task definitions
- STATE: Current agent runtime conditions
Importance Score: 95

2. Semantic Field Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Field mapping by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Bidirectional translation verification
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Custom mapping rules for non-standard fields
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Hierarchical trust levels:
  - Internal: Verified first-party protocols
  - Verified: Tested third-party protocols
  - Experimental: New protocol implementations
  - Community: User-contributed protocols
- Specification verification with expiration
- Fallback mechanisms for offline operation
Importance Score: 85

4. Agent Morphing Logic
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Identity preservation during protocol transitions
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation
- Protocol-specific feature handling
Importance Score: 90

The semantic category system enables protocol-agnostic agent translation through meaning-based field mapping rather than direct structural mapping. The system maintains semantic integrity during translations while preserving agent identity and capabilities across different protocols.

## Core Category System

The semantic category system maps fields across protocols based on their underlying meaning rather than field names, with three key components:

1. Category Definitions
- Identity Categories: agent_id, name, description, version
- Capability Categories: skills, tools, permissions, limitations
- Interaction Categories: input_format, output_format, constraints
- Memory Categories: context, history, knowledge_base
- Control Categories: goals, directives, policies

2. Mapping Rules
- Field-to-Category Assignment: Each field gets assigned primary and secondary categories
- Cross-Protocol Translation: Fields map between protocols if they share categories
- Fallback Chain: Multiple category matches handled in priority order
- Context Preservation: Category context must be maintained during translation

3. Translation Algorithms 
- Category Detection: ML model identifies semantic category of unknown fields
- Confidence Scoring: Calculates match confidence between fields
- Context Validation: Verifies category context is preserved
- Fallback Selection: Chooses best alternative when exact match unavailable

Implementation Location:
`src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts`
- Contains semantic category definitions and mapping rules
- Implements category-based field translation

`memory_system/semantic/decomposer.py`
- Handles semantic parsing and category detection
- Manages translation confidence scoring

Importance Score: 95
The semantic category system is critical for enabling protocol-agnostic agent communication while preserving meaning.
