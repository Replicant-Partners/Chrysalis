description: Defines semantic category system for protocol mapping, translations, and meaning-based field processing
---


# semantic-categories

The semantic category system implements specialized meaning-based protocol translation:

1. Core Semantic Categories 
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- IDENTITY: Agent self-definition and core traits
- CAPABILITIES: Agent skills and abilities
- INSTRUCTIONS: Command and task definitions
- STATE: Current agent runtime conditions
Importance Score: 95

2. Semantic Field Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Field mapping by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Bidirectional translation verification
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Custom mapping rules for non-standard fields
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Hierarchical trust levels:
  - Internal: Verified first-party protocols
  - Verified: Tested third-party protocols
  - Experimental: New protocol implementations
  - Community: User-contributed protocols
- Specification verification with expiration
- Fallback mechanisms for offline operation
Importance Score: 85

4. Agent Morphing Logic
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Identity preservation during protocol transitions
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation
- Protocol-specific feature handling
Importance Score: 90

The semantic category system enables protocol-agnostic agent translation through meaning-based field mapping rather than direct structural mapping. The system maintains semantic integrity during translations while preserving agent identity and capabilities across different protocols.
