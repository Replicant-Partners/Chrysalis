# semantic-categories

The semantic category system implements specialized meaning-based protocol translation:

1. Core Semantic Categories 
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- IDENTITY: Agent self-definition and core traits
- CAPABILITIES: Agent skills and abilities
- INSTRUCTIONS: Command and task definitions
- STATE: Current agent runtime conditions
Importance Score: 95

2. Semantic Field Translation
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Field mapping by semantic meaning rather than structure
- Bidirectional translation verification
- Protocol-specific translation hints
- Custom mapping rules for non-standard fields
Importance Score: 90

3. Protocol Trust System
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Hierarchical trust levels:
  - Internal: Verified first-party protocols
  - Verified: Tested third-party protocols
  - Experimental: New protocol implementations
  - Community: User-contributed protocols
- Specification verification with expiration
- Fallback mechanisms for offline operation
Importance Score: 85

4. Agent Morphing Logic
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Identity preservation during protocol transitions
- Capability equivalence maintenance
- Extension field preservation
- Protocol-specific feature handling
Importance Score: 90

The semantic category system enables protocol-agnostic agent translation through meaning-based field mapping rather than direct structural mapping. The system maintains semantic integrity during translations while preserving agent identity and capabilities across different protocols.

description: Documents the semantic category system for translating fields between agent protocols based on their meaning rather than syntax
## Core Category System
The semantic category system maps fields across protocols based on their underlying meaning rather than field names, with three key components:
1. Category Definitions
- Identity Categories: agent_id, name, description, version
- Capability Categories: skills, tools, permissions, limitations
- Interaction Categories: input_format, output_format, constraints
- Memory Categories: context, history, knowledge_base
- Control Categories: goals, directives, policies
2. Mapping Rules
- Field-to-Category Assignment: Each field gets assigned primary and secondary categories
- Cross-Protocol Translation: Fields map between protocols if they share categories
- Fallback Chain: Multiple category matches handled in priority order
- Context Preservation: Category context must be maintained during translation
3. Translation Algorithms 
- Category Detection: ML model identifies semantic category of unknown fields
- Confidence Scoring: Calculates match confidence between fields
- Context Validation: Verifies category context is preserved
- Fallback Selection: Chooses best alternative when exact match unavailable
Implementation Location:
`src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts`
- Contains semantic category definitions and mapping rules
- Implements category-based field translation
`memory_system/semantic/decomposer.py`
- Handles semantic parsing and category detection
- Manages translation confidence scoring
Importance Score: 95
The semantic category system is critical for enabling protocol-agnostic agent communication while preserving meaning.

# semantic-categories

Core Semantic Categories System:

1. Category Definition Framework
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Six foundational semantic categories:
  * IDENTITY: Agent core identifiers and self-knowledge
  * CAPABILITIES: Tools, skills, and action abilities
  * INSTRUCTIONS: Behavioral guidance and constraints
  * STATE: Memory and contextual awareness
  * COMMUNICATION: Interaction styles and patterns
  * EXECUTION: Runtime configuration and settings

2. Field Translation Logic
Path: src/adapters/universal/index.ts
- Meaning-based field mapping between protocols
- Maps semantically equivalent fields regardless of naming:
  * tool → capability
  * skill → ability
  * memory → context
  * profile → identity
- Preserves semantic meaning during protocol translation

3. Semantic Mapping Rules
- Bidirectional field translation based on semantic categories
- Category-specific validation rules
- Context preservation during translation
- Semantic equivalence checking

The system enables protocol-agnostic translation by mapping fields based on their semantic meaning rather than syntax, allowing interoperability between different agent frameworks while preserving semantic intent.

description: Specifies semantic categorization system for agent capabilities and knowledge domains
Semantic Category System:
1. Category Definition Engine
File: src/adapters/universal/semantic/categories.ts
- Implements hierarchical capability categorization with:
  - Core capabilities (reasoning, memory, knowledge)
  - Domain capabilities (coding, writing, analysis)
  - Tool capabilities (web search, code generation, math)
- Maps semantic relationships between categories
- Enforces category inheritance rules and constraints
- Validates category compatibility across frameworks
2. Category Resolution System
File: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Resolves semantic equivalence between different protocol categories
- Maps framework-specific capabilities to universal categories
- Handles bidirectional category translation
- Maintains category confidence scoring
- Implements category drift detection
3. Semantic Mapping Rules
File: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Category inheritance validation
- Cross-framework capability mapping
- Semantic hint generation for translations
- Category relationship tracking
- Framework-specific category extensions
4. Category Validation Engine
File: src/adapters/adaptation/pattern-sensor-manager.ts
- Validates category assignments across protocols
- Detects category pattern evolution
- Tracks category usage metrics
- Manages category deprecation cycles
- Implements category health scoring
Core Business Rules:
- Categories must maintain semantic meaning across translations
- Category relationships follow strict inheritance rules
- Framework extensions must map to universal categories
- Category confidence requires minimum threshold
- Categories support versioning and deprecation
