Core Data Flow Architecture (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
Importance Score: 95/100

1. Semantic Translation Flow
- Maps fields by semantic meaning instead of syntax
- Uses semantic category classification (IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, STATE)
- Maintains bidirectional translation verification
- Features LLM-delegated translation engine
- Implements protocol discovery and registration

2. Protocol Trust System (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 90/100
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification with expiration tracking
- Fallback schemas for offline operation
- Protocol compatibility versioning

3. Agent Identity Preservation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 85/100
- Maintains agent identity across protocol transformations
- Preserves capability equivalence during translation
- Handles extension field preservation
- Implements semantic hint mapping system

4. Protocol Translation Pipeline
Importance Score: 85/100
- Semantic category mapping across protocols
- LLM-based semantic understanding system
- Capability discovery and matching
- Bidirectional verification of translations

Key Data Flows:
- Agent Protocol Translation: Original Protocol -> Semantic Categories -> Target Protocol
- Trust Verification: Protocol Registration -> Trust Level Assignment -> Verification Status
- Identity Flow: Source Identity -> Morphing Layer -> Target Identity
- Capability Mapping: Source Capabilities -> Semantic Understanding -> Target Implementation

The system implements unique semantic-based protocol translation rather than traditional adapter patterns, focusing on meaning preservation across different agent frameworks.

description: Documents data flow patterns between components, including protocol translation, semantic preservation, and extension handling
The system implements a multi-tier data flow architecture focused on protocol translation and semantic preservation:
## Protocol Translation Layer
- Universal Protocol Registry manages bidirectional mappings between agent frameworks
- Semantic equivalence definitions preserve meaning during translation
- Field transformation rules handle protocol-specific requirements
- Extension field management system for non-standard protocol features
- LLM-based translation prompts with semantic category mapping
## Semantic Preservation Flow
Key files: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts, src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Tools ↔ Capabilities ↔ Functions mapping system 
- Protocol version negotiation with compatibility scoring
- Automatic fallback strategies for incompatible versions
- Feature detection and capability matrix maintenance
- Protocol capability detection and matching logic
## Pattern Detection System
Key file: src/adapters/adaptation/pattern-sensor-manager.ts
- Evolutionary pattern detection in protocol translations
- Protocol health metrics tracking and analysis
- Automatic adaptation triggers based on quality thresholds
- Protocol behavior adjustment based on performance data
- Conversion quality metrics with historical trending
## Extension Field Management
- Custom field preservation during translations
- Protocol-specific metadata handling rules
- Extension namespace management
- Field compatibility verification system
- Default value generation for missing fields
The system's core data flow revolves around maintaining semantic equivalence during protocol translation while preserving protocol-specific extensions and metadata. Pattern detection enables automatic adaptation of translation strategies based on observed behavior.
