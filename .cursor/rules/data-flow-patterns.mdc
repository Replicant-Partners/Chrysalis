Core Data Flow Architecture (src/adapters/universal/index.ts)
Importance Score: 95/100

1. Semantic Translation Flow
- Maps fields by semantic meaning instead of syntax
- Uses semantic category classification (IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, STATE)
- Maintains bidirectional translation verification
- Features LLM-delegated translation engine
- Implements protocol discovery and registration

2. Protocol Trust System (src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 90/100
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification with expiration tracking
- Fallback schemas for offline operation
- Protocol compatibility versioning

3. Agent Identity Preservation (src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts)
Importance Score: 85/100
- Maintains agent identity across protocol transformations
- Preserves capability equivalence during translation
- Handles extension field preservation
- Implements semantic hint mapping system

4. Protocol Translation Pipeline
Importance Score: 85/100
- Semantic category mapping across protocols
- LLM-based semantic understanding system
- Capability discovery and matching
- Bidirectional verification of translations

Key Data Flows:
- Agent Protocol Translation: Original Protocol -> Semantic Categories -> Target Protocol
- Trust Verification: Protocol Registration -> Trust Level Assignment -> Verification Status
- Identity Flow: Source Identity -> Morphing Layer -> Target Identity
- Capability Mapping: Source Capabilities -> Semantic Understanding -> Target Implementation

The system implements unique semantic-based protocol translation rather than traditional adapter patterns, focusing on meaning preservation across different agent frameworks.
