Core Morphing Components:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation Engine
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
Importance Score: 95
- Semantic category mapping system for bidirectional agent translation 
- Core categories: IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE
- Protocol-specific translation hints and mapping rules
- Identity preservation morphing logic

2. Protocol Registry 
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
Importance Score: 90
- Protocol specifications with semantic hints
- Trust level tracking and verification timestamps
- Protocol field mappings with transformation rules
- Protocol compatibility versioning
- Fallback schemas for offline operation

3. Translation Verification System
Path: src/adapters/universal/index.ts 
Importance Score: 85
- LLM-delegated protocol translation engine
- Dynamic protocol discovery and registration
- Bidirectional translation verification
- Specification caching and validation

Key Morphing Patterns:

1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Field mapping by semantic meaning vs syntax
- LLM-based concept equivalence detection
- Semantic integrity validation

2. Protocol Trust System
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification with expiration
- Fallback handling for offline scenarios

3. Agent Identity Preservation
- Core identity maintenance during morphing
- Capability equivalence verification
- Protocol-specific extension preservation

The morphing system uses LLM-based semantic understanding rather than direct field mapping, allowing protocol-agnostic translations while maintaining agent identity and capabilities across transformations.
