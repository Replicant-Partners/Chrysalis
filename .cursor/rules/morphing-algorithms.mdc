Core Morphing Components:

1. Semantic Protocol Translation Engine
Path: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
Importance Score: 95
- Semantic category mapping system for bidirectional agent translation 
- Core categories: IDENTITY, CAPABILITIES, INSTRUCTIONS, STATE
- Protocol-specific translation hints and mapping rules
- Identity preservation morphing logic

2. Protocol Registry 
Path: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
Importance Score: 90
- Protocol specifications with semantic hints
- Trust level tracking and verification timestamps
- Protocol field mappings with transformation rules
- Protocol compatibility versioning
- Fallback schemas for offline operation

3. Translation Verification System
Path: src/adapters/universal/index.ts 
Importance Score: 85
- LLM-delegated protocol translation engine
- Dynamic protocol discovery and registration
- Bidirectional translation verification
- Specification caching and validation

Key Morphing Patterns:

1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Field mapping by semantic meaning vs syntax
- LLM-based concept equivalence detection
- Semantic integrity validation

2. Protocol Trust System
- Hierarchical trust levels (internal, verified, experimental, community)
- Specification verification with expiration
- Fallback handling for offline scenarios

3. Agent Identity Preservation
- Core identity maintenance during morphing
- Capability equivalence verification
- Protocol-specific extension preservation

The morphing system uses LLM-based semantic understanding rather than direct field mapping, allowing protocol-agnostic translations while maintaining agent identity and capabilities across transformations.

## Universal Translation Architecture

The core morphing system implements bidirectional translation between agent protocols using:

1. Semantic Category Mapping
- Maps fields based on semantic meaning rather than syntax
- Uses domain-specific protocol hints for accurate translation
- Located in: src/adapters/universal/prompts-v2.ts
- Importance Score: 90

2. Field Translation Engine
- Translates agent capabilities across protocol boundaries
- Maintains semantic equivalence during morphing
- Handles partial matches and capability degradation
- Located in: src/adapters/universal/index.ts  
- Importance Score: 85

3. Adaptive Morphing Pipeline
- Dynamic protocol negotiation based on agent capabilities
- Progressive enhancement of translated capabilities
- Confidence scoring for translation quality
- Located in: src/adaptation/AdaptationTracker.ts
- Importance Score: 80

4. Protocol Evolution Management
- Tracks protocol version changes and deprecations
- Implements rolling upgrades of agent translations
- Handles breaking changes with fallback behaviors
- Located in: src/ai-maintenance/evolutionary-patterns.ts
- Importance Score: 85

5. Translation Confidence System
- Scores translation fidelity across protocol boundaries
- Tracks successful vs failed translations
- Adapts translation strategies based on success rates
- Located in: src/adapters/universal/registry-v2.ts
- Importance Score: 75

Key Business Components:
- Protocol-specific semantic hints
- Capability preservation guarantees
- Progressive capability enhancement
- Translation confidence tracking
- Protocol evolution management
- Breaking change detection
