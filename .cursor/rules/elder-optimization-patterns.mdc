From Ludwig_agent_reflection.py:

## Cognitive Load Management
Importance Score: 95

Specialized algorithms for reducing mental strain in elderly users:

1. Progressive Disclosure System
- Segments complex workflows into digestible chunks
- Dynamically adjusts information density based on user performance
- Tracks cognitive fatigue indicators through interaction patterns
- Adapts content presentation rates in real-time

2. Memory Support Framework 
- Implements spaced repetition for critical interface elements
- Maintains persistent visual anchors across sessions
- Provides contextual reminders for partially completed tasks
- Records and reinforces successful interaction patterns

3. Error Prevention System
- Proactively identifies potential mistake patterns
- Implements multi-stage confirmation for critical actions
- Provides clear recovery paths from error states
- Maintains interaction history for pattern analysis

## Accessibility Optimizations
Importance Score: 90

1. Dynamic Text Scaling
- Adjusts font sizes based on reading speed and error rates
- Maintains minimum contrast ratios of 7:1
- Implements automatic line height adjustments
- Preserves layout stability during text scaling

2. Motion Control System
- Reduces animation speeds for improved tracking
- Implements pause functionality for moving elements
- Provides static alternatives for dynamic content
- Tracks user motion sensitivity preferences

3. Input Assistance
- Extends interaction timeouts automatically
- Implements tremor compensation for click actions
- Provides alternative input methods based on capability
- Maintains consistent input patterns across sessions

## Behavioral Adaptation System
Importance Score: 85

1. Session Management
- Tracks optimal session durations
- Implements guided break suggestions
- Maintains progress markers for extended tasks
- Provides session resumption assistance

2. Learning Pattern Recognition
- Identifies common interaction difficulties
- Adapts interface complexity progressively
- Maintains personalized assistance levels
- Implements guided feature discovery

3. Confidence Building
- Provides positive reinforcement for completed actions
- Implements graduated difficulty progression
- Maintains achievement history
- Tracks and encourages improvement patterns
