- Tracks learning progress across related family members
- Supports shared learning experiences between caregivers and care recipients

2. Family Permission System
- Manages access rights between family members
- Implements role-based permissions for caregivers
- Supports temporary delegation of access
- Tracks permission history and changes

3. Caregiver Dashboard Integration
- Real-time status sharing between family members
- Permission-aware data aggregation for family groups
- Multi-caregiver coordination support
- Family-specific alert and notification routing

The implementation focuses on managing complex family relationships and permissions in a care context, with particular emphasis on knowledge sharing and access control between family members.
