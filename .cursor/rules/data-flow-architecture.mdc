# data-flow-architecture

Core Data Flow Components:

1. Memory Verification Data Pipeline
Path: teams/team_6_memory_verification.py
- Memory validation data flows through gentle validation stages
- Timeline reconstruction data processing with uncertainty weighting
- Family memory collaboration data streams with reality checking
- Gamified cognitive exercise data pathways for elder engagement
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Family Data Integration Hub
Path: teams/team_5_family_features.py 
- Multi-directional family permission data flows using Open Policy Agent
- Caregiver dashboard data streams with privacy filtering
- Family event photo coordination with AI grouping pipelines
- Cross-generational memory sharing data paths
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Elder-Optimized Frontend Data Router
Path: teams/team_4_frontend_elder.py
- Cognitive load-aware state management flows
- Elder-first component data pathways with accessibility transforms
- PWA data caching optimized for elder devices
- Form data validation with elder-friendly error flows
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Data Flow Patterns:
- Bidirectional memory verification between family members and system
- Privacy-filtered data sharing between caregivers and elders
- Cognitive load balanced data presentation paths
- Multi-stage reality checking data flows
- Family event coordination data streams

Integration Architecture:
- Memory verification system feeds validated data to family features
- Family features route filtered content to elder frontend
- Frontend provides cognitive-aware data collection back to verification
- Cross-component data flows preserve privacy and cognitive load constraints
