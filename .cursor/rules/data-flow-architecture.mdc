## Primary Data Flow Components

### Memory Verification Pipeline
`memory_system/semantic/decomposer.py` -> `memory_system/semantic/strategies/*` -> `memory_system/analysis/shannon.py`

- Multi-stage verification flow for elder memory validation
- Gentle reality checking with family collaboration hooks
- Timeline reconstruction from photo metadata
- Confidence scoring for memory validation results
Importance Score: 85

### Family Feature Integration
`projects/GaryVision/teams/team_5_family_features.py` -> `memory_system/embedding/service.py`

- Privacy-aware family photo sharing workflow
- Multi-generational access control patterns
- Caregiver activity monitoring with consent management
- Family event coordination data paths
Importance Score: 90

### Frontend Elder Optimization Flow
`projects/GaryVision/teams/team_4_frontend_elder.py` -> `memory_system/semantic/models.py`

- Elder-optimized UI state management paths
- Progressive disclosure navigation flows
- Cognitive load monitoring feedback loops
- Session recovery data persistence patterns
Importance Score: 80

### Knowledge Integration Pipeline
`memory_system/embedding/service.py` -> `memory_system/graph/store.py`

- Provider-aware embedding generation workflow
- Cost-optimized provider fallback paths
- Quality-controlled embedding validation flow
- Graph-based knowledge integration patterns
Importance Score: 85

### Adaptation Integration Flow
`src/adaptation/integration/AdaptationIntegrationFacade.ts` -> `src/adaptation/LearningLoop.ts`

- Evidence-based pattern learning pipeline
- Experience synchronization workflows
- Quality-driven validation paths
- Multi-agent coordination flows
Importance Score: 75
