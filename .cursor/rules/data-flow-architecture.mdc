Core Data Flow Components:

1. Memory Verification Data Pipeline
Path: teams/team_6_memory_verification.py
- Memory validation data flows through gentle validation stages
- Timeline reconstruction data processing with uncertainty weighting
- Family memory collaboration data streams with reality checking
- Gamified cognitive exercise data pathways for elder engagement
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Family Data Integration Hub
Path: teams/team_5_family_features.py 
- Multi-directional family permission data flows using Open Policy Agent
- Caregiver dashboard data streams with privacy filtering
- Family event photo coordination with AI grouping pipelines
- Cross-generational memory sharing data paths
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Elder-Optimized Frontend Data Router
Path: teams/team_4_frontend_elder.py
- Cognitive load-aware state management flows
- Elder-first component data pathways with accessibility transforms
- PWA data caching optimized for elder devices
- Form data validation with elder-friendly error flows
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Data Flow Patterns:
- Bidirectional memory verification between family members and system
- Privacy-filtered data sharing between caregivers and elders
- Cognitive load balanced data presentation paths
- Multi-stage reality checking data flows
- Family event coordination data streams

Integration Architecture:
- Memory verification system feeds validated data to family features
- Family features route filtered content to elder frontend
- Frontend provides cognitive-aware data collection back to verification
- Cross-component data flows preserve privacy and cognitive load constraints

## Core Data Flow Components

### Agent Knowledge Management Flow
**Importance Score: 85**
- Implements bidirectional data flow between agent knowledge states and LanceDB storage
- Central knowledge builder entities track semantic relationships 
- Versioned manifests maintain state consistency across distributed components
- Transaction logs ensure ACID properties for knowledge updates

### Meta-Cognitive Reflection Pipeline
**Importance Score: 90**
- Ludwig agent reflection system processes self-analysis data flows
- Knowledge graph updates flow through validation and convergence stages
- Calibration metrics feed back into confidence assessment loops
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing implemented via distributed message patterns

### Memory Integration Patterns
**Importance Score: 75**
- Episodic memory flows integrate with semantic knowledge structures
- Pattern resolution logic determines optimal data routing
- State convergence functions merge distributed memory updates
- Schema validation ensures data integrity across flow boundaries

## Key Integration Points

### Memory Verification Flow
**Importance Score: 80**
- Sequential validation of memory state transitions
- Convergence functions handle conflict resolution
- Pattern-based routing of verification results
- Transaction isolation for concurrent updates

### Family Feature Integration 
**Importance Score: 70**
- Knowledge inheritance patterns between related agents
- Shared memory spaces for family-level concepts
- Synchronized state updates across family members
- Conflict resolution for overlapping knowledge domains

Implementation Files:
- Ludwig_agent_reflection.py
- chrysalis/usa/core.clj
