Data Flow Components:

1. Memory Verification Pipeline
Path: src/memory/verification/VerificationPipeline.ts
- Bidirectional data flow between working memory and verification system
- Memory confidence scoring based on cross-instance consensus 
- Event streaming for memory validation state changes
- Asynchronous verification results propagation
Importance Score: 85

2. Family Features Integration
Path: src/family/FamilyIntegrationManager.ts
- Privacy-preserving data flow between family members and caregivers
- Relationship-based access control for memory sharing
- Multi-generational event synchronization
- Caregiver monitoring data streams
Importance Score: 90

3. Frontend Memory Bridge
Path: src/frontend/bridges/MemoryBridge.ts
- Real-time memory state synchronization
- Batched update propagation for UI components
- Memory verification status visualization
- Family relationship visualization data streams
Importance Score: 80

Key Data Flow Patterns:
- Privacy-first data propagation between family members
- Byzantine-resistant memory verification flows
- Event-based UI synchronization for memory states
- Relationship-aware access control for data sharing

The architecture implements specialized data flows focused on elder care requirements, family relationships, and memory verification with strong privacy guarantees.
