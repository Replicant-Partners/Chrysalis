System-wide data flows are organized around three core components:

1. Memory Verification Pipeline
- Memory validation with Byzantine-resistant consensus requiring 2/3 node agreement 
- Bidirectional flow between episodic and semantic memory tiers
- CRDT-based memory synchronization for conflict-free merging
- Custom gossip protocol for O(log N) memory propagation across nodes
Importance Score: 90

2. Family Features Data Flow
- Multi-generational permission model using Open Policy Agent
- Bidirectional sync between family member photo collections
- Privacy-aware caregiver monitoring data streams
- Cross-generation UX adaptation data transformation
Importance Score: 85

3. Frontend Data Integration
