# memory-verification-system

The memory verification system implements specialized validation for elder user memories with emphasis on gentle verification and supportive feedback.

Core Components:

1. Timeline Reconstruction (Importance: 95/100)
File: projects/GaryVision/teams/team_6_memory_verification.py
- Chronological organization of memories with flexible uncertainty handling
- Fuzzy date matching for approximate timeline placement 
- Family event correlation and cross-referencing
- Supportive correction mechanisms for timeline inconsistencies

2. Reality Check Engine (Importance: 90/100)
- Gentle validation against known historical facts
- Family member memory correlation
- Photo metadata verification
- Location and event plausibility checking
- Supportive feedback generation for memory discrepancies

3. Uncertainty Management (Importance: 85/100)
- Multiple confidence level tracking
- Partial memory validation support
- Fuzzy matching for similar but inexact memories
- Preservation of elder user's memory perspective while gently noting variations

4. Family Memory Collaboration (Importance: 85/100)
- Shared memory validation workflows
- Family member verification requests
- Collaborative timeline building
- Multi-generational memory correlation

The system prioritizes elder emotional wellbeing while providing accurate but gentle memory verification through family collaboration and supportive feedback mechanisms.
