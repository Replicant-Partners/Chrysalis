# memory-verification-system

## Memory Validation Core
**File:** `memory_system/semantic/strategies/base.py`
Importance Score: 90

Implements gentle memory validation using multi-strategy verification:
- Timeline reconstruction with flexible date handling
- Reality checking with suggestive rather than corrective approaches
- Uncertainty quantification for memory claims
- Family memory collaboration with privacy controls

## Timeline Reconstruction Engine
**File:** `memory_system/semantic/models.py`
Importance Score: 85

Custom timeline analysis system:
- Temporal uncertainty modeling using fuzzy date ranges
- Event correlation across multiple memory sources
- Confidence scoring for timeline placement
- Context-aware date inference from related memories

## Memory Conflict Resolution
**File:** `teams/team_6_memory_verification.py`
Importance Score: 80

Specialized conflict handling for elder memory validation:
- Gentle correction strategies avoiding direct contradiction
- Multi-source verification with family member input
- Privacy-aware sharing controls for sensitive memories
- Engagement patterns designed as memory games

## Semantic Memory Analysis
**File:** `memory_system/semantic/decomposer.py`
Importance Score: 75

Memory decomposition and analysis:
- Semantic relationship extraction between memory elements
- Context preservation during verification
- Memory fragment linking with confidence scoring
- Reality anchoring through external fact validation

The system implements a specialized approach to memory verification focused on elder care, emphasizing gentle validation and family collaboration while maintaining dignity and emotional wellbeing.
