## Core Memory Verification Components

### Timeline Reconstruction Engine
File: `Ludwig_agent_reflection.py`
Importance Score: 95

The timeline reconstruction engine maintains temporal consistency across agent memories through:

1. Temporal Anchoring System
- Identifies fixed reference points in memory timelines 
- Assigns confidence scores to temporal relationships
- Resolves conflicts between competing timeline interpretations
- Maintains causal consistency between related memories

2. Memory Convergence Protocol
- Merges overlapping memories from different temporal perspectives
- Resolves contradictions through confidence-weighted voting
- Preserves causal chains during memory consolidation

### Reality Checking System 
File: `clojure/usa/src/chrysalis/usa/core.clj`
Importance Score: 85

Implements multi-layer verification:

1. Internal Consistency Check
```clojure
(defn validate-memory-consistency [memory]
  (-> memory
      (check-temporal-order)
      (validate-causal-links)
      (verify-entity-continuity)))
```

2. External Reality Alignment
- Compares memory patterns against known reality models
- Flags improbable or impossible memory sequences
- Calculates reality-alignment scores for memory clusters

### Uncertainty Handler
File: `Ludwig_agent_reflection.py`
Importance Score: 80

Manages ambiguity in memory verification:
- Tracks confidence levels for individual memory elements
- Maintains probability distributions for uncertain temporal relationships
- Implements fuzzy matching for partially-aligned memories
- Provides graceful degradation for low-confidence memories

### Memory Chain Validator
File: `clojure/usa/src/chrysalis/usa/core.clj`
Importance Score: 75

Validates memory sequences through:
1. Chain integrity checks
2. Causal relationship verification
3. Entity persistence validation
4. Temporal boundary enforcement
