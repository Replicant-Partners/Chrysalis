Quality Integration Tests

This package contains integration tests for validating higher-order quality goals:

- test_sovereignty.py: Sovereignty preservation tests
  - Cryptographic identity integrity
  - Byzantine fault tolerance
  - Trust tier enforcement
  - Memory sanitization
  - Override capabilities

- test_capability_enablement.py: AI capability enablement tests
  - Lossless morphing round-trips
  - Experience sync convergence
  - Adapter semantic correctness
  - Protocol extensibility
  - Memory deduplication

These tests ensure the system maintains its architectural guarantees
beyond functional correctness.
