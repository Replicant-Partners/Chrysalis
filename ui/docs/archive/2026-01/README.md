## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during the MVP development phase but have been superseded by comprehensive, authoritative documentation that provides a single source of truth:

1. **Session Summaries** → Consolidated into development progress report
2. **Verification Reports** → Integrated into continuous build verification
3. **Interim Plans** → Finalized in current specifications
4. **Thread Prompts** → No longer needed (MVP complete)
5. **Gap Analysis** → Addressed in current status
